## About this module
Learn essential security practices to protect your Web3 startup from common vulnerabilities and threats.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will learn how to:
- Assess your project's technical and security readiness as a non-technical founder
- Implement key components of IT governance that early-stage startups often overlook
- Establish best practices for managing private keys, admin privileges, and wallets
- Make informed decisions about on-chain versus off-chain data storage to mitigate risks

## Why Security Matters for Web3 Startups

The Web3 ecosystem presents unique security challenges. Unlike traditional applications, blockchain projects often manage digital assets directly, making security not just a best practice but an essential business requirement. A single security breach can lead to irreversible loss of funds, damaged reputation, and potential regulatory consequences.
