In this section you will learn how to set up Core wallet and get some testnet AVAX on the P-Chain so
you can launch your first L1.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Install Core Wallet

If you don't have Core Wallet installed already, head to the [Chome Web
Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/core-crypto-wallet-nft-ex/agoakfejjabomempkjlepdflaleeobhb)
and install it. Since you will need to issue P-Chain transactions and you will need a compatible wallet,
unfortunately, the MetaMask or other popular wallet extension are not supported.

<Step>

### Connect Core

Click the `Connect Wallet` button below:

### Claim Testnet AVAX from the Faucet

Copy the coupon code:

```
avalanche-academy
```

Now head to the [Avalanche Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) and claim
some AVAX tokens on the C-Chain of the Fuji testnet. Enter the coupon code in the according field.

</Step>
<Step>

### Bridge AVAX to the P-Chain

Next, we need to transfer the AVAX you've just claimed from the Faucet on the C-Chain to the
P-Chain. Bridge 0.9 AVAX over.
