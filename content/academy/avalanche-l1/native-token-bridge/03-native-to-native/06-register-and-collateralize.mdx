# Register and Collateralize

Before you can bridge AVAX to your L1, you need to:

1. **Register** the NativeTokenRemote with the NativeTokenHome
2. **Add collateral** to back any pre-existing native token supply

## Step 1: Register Remote with Home

Registration creates a secure, bidirectional connection between the contracts. The home contract must know about the remote before accepting bridge requests.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Switch to Your L1

Ensure your wallet is connected to **your L1** (where NativeTokenRemote is deployed).

</Step>

<Step>
### Register the Remote

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Successfully deployed NativeTokenRemote
2. Native tokens on your L1 for gas fees
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
    <RegisterWithHome />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Add Collateral

Collateral is required to back any native tokens that might already exist on your L1. The bridge needs to be fully collateralized before minting is enabled.

### Why Collateral?

When NativeTokenRemote mints native tokens, it's creating real gas tokens. The protocol requires:

1. **Collateral Amount** = Initial Reserve Imbalance you set during deployment
2. **Full Collateralization** = AVAX deposited on Fuji (wrapped as WAVAX)
3. **Minting Enabled** = Only after full collateralization

<Callout type="info">
If you set `initialReserveImbalance` to `0` during deployment, you may not need to add collateral. The tool will show the required amount.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### Switch to Fuji C-Chain

Switch your wallet to **Fuji C-Chain** (where NativeTokenHome is deployed).

</Step>

<Step>
### Add Collateral

The tool will show how much AVAX collateral is required. You need to deposit this amount to fully collateralize the bridge.

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Connected to Fuji C-Chain
2. Enough AVAX to cover the collateral requirement
3. Additional AVAX for gas fees
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <AddCollateral />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Bridge State After Collateralization

After completing both steps:

- ✅ NativeTokenRemote is registered with NativeTokenHome
- ✅ Bridge is fully collateralized
- ✅ AVAX can now be bridged to your L1 as native tokens
- ✅ Native tokens can be bridged back to Fuji as AVAX

## Next Steps

Your bridge is fully configured! Let's test it by bridging some AVAX.
