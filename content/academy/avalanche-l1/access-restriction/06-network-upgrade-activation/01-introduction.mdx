## Overview

In the previous section you **disabled** the Transaction AllowList and Contract Deployer AllowList precompiles via a network upgrade. Now you’ll do the same process in reverse: **append new upgrade entries** that re-enable both precompiles.

Because disabling clears precompile storage, re-enabling is effectively a fresh initialization. For these allowlist precompiles, that means you must set initial **`adminAddresses`** so you can manage roles after activation.

## Key Concepts

The rules from the official guide still apply:

- `upgrade.json` lives at `{chain-config-dir}/{blockchainID}/upgrade.json` next to `config.json`.
- `precompileUpgrades` must be treated as **append-only** once upgrades activate.
- `blockTimestamp` must be **in the future** and upgrades must be in **increasing order**.
- You must include your wallet address in `adminAddresses` for both precompiles.
