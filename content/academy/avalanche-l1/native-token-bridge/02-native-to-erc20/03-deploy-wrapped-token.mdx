# Deploy Wrapped Token

Before deploying NativeTokenHome, you need a **wrapped version** of your native token. This is an ERC-20 that represents your native token 1:1.

## Why Wrapped Tokens?

Native tokens (like your L1's gas token) can't be directly used in ERC-20 compatible contracts. A wrapped token:

- Is an **ERC-20** that wraps native tokens 1:1
- Allows **deposit** (native → wrapped) and **withdraw** (wrapped → native)
- Is required by **NativeTokenHome** to lock tokens

<Callout type="info">
This is the same concept as **WAVAX** on C-Chain or **WETH** on Ethereum.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect to Your L1

Switch your wallet to your L1 where your custom native token lives.

</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy Wrapped Token

Use the Deploy Wrapped Native tool to deploy a wrapped version of your native token:

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Connected to your L1
2. Native tokens (TEST) for gas fees
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
    <DeployWrappedNative />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Save the Contract Address

After deployment, save the **Wrapped Token Address**. You'll need it when deploying NativeTokenHome.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Contract Features

Your wrapped token contract supports:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `deposit()` | Wrap native tokens → receive wrapped tokens |
| `withdraw(amount)` | Burn wrapped tokens → receive native tokens |
| `balanceOf(address)` | Check wrapped token balance |
| Standard ERC-20 | `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`, etc. |

## Next Steps

Now set up the relayer between your L1 and C-Chain.
