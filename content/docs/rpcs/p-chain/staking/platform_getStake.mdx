          GetStake returns the amount of nAVAX that [args.Addresses] have
          cumulatively staked on the Primary Network. This method assumes that
          each stake output has only owner This method assumes only AVAX can be
          staked This method only concerns itself with the Primary Network, not
          subnets TODO: Improve the performance of this method by maintaining
          this data in a data structure rather than re-calculating it by
          iterating over stakers
