First-time founders often make these critical errors:

1. **Confusing audience with community**: Having followers doesn't equal having engaged participants.

2. **Chasing growth without depth**: Fast growth without engagement creates an empty ecosystem.

3. **Relying on token incentives for loyalty**: Airdrops rarely create lasting engagement.

4. **Neglecting real-world connections**: In-person relationships strengthen online interactions and improve conflict resolution.

5. **Failing to automate onboarding**: Without verification bots and welcome systems, spam can quickly overwhelm and drive away genuine members.
