import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';
import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/toolbox/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx";
import ICMRelayer from "@/components/toolbox/console/icm/setup/ICMRelayer";

Native-token bridging uses Interchain Messaging under the hood, so you must run a relayer between **Fuji C-Chain** and your **new L1**.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="l1">
  <ICMRelayer />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

In the tool:
- Select **Fuji C-Chain** and your **new L1** as the networks to relay between.
- Fund the generated relayer address with enough gas on **both** chains.
- Run the provided Docker command to start the relayer.

<Callout type="info">
If you don’t have the relayer running, cross-chain messages will be created but **never delivered**, and your bridge transfers will appear “stuck”.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

With the relayer running, you’re ready to deploy `NativeTokenRemote` on your L1.
