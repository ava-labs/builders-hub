## Get Free Testnet Tokens

With a Builder Hub account and connected wallet, you'll **automatically receive testnet tokens** on C-Chain, P-Chain, Dispatch, Echo, and other supported L1s. No coupon codes needed!

**How it works:**
1. Create a Builder Hub account (if you haven't already)
2. Connect your Core wallet
3. Tokens are automatically sent to your wallet when needed

### Alternative Faucet

If you prefer not to create a [Builder Hub account](https://build.avax.network/login), you can also use the external [Avalanche Testnet Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?token=c) with coupon code: **avalanche-academy**

If you experience any issues claiming testnet tokens, please reach out in the <a href="https://t.me/avalancheacademy" target='_blank'>Avalanche Academy Telegram Chat</a>, so our Developer Relations team can assist you.
