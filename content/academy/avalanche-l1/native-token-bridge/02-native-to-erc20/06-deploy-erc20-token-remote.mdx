# Deploy ERC20TokenRemote

The `ERC20TokenRemote` contract is deployed on **Fuji C-Chain**. It mints ERC-20 tokens representing your L1's native token when users bridge from your L1.

## Understanding ERC20TokenRemote

The ERC20TokenRemote contract:

- **Mints ERC-20 tokens** when receiving bridge messages from your L1
- **Burns ERC-20 tokens** when users bridge back to your L1
- **Is itself an ERC-20 token** (users can transfer, trade, etc.)
- **References the NativeTokenHome** on your L1 for security

<Steps>
<Step>
### Switch to Fuji C-Chain

Switch your wallet to **Fuji C-Chain**. This is where you'll deploy the ERC-20 representation of your token.

</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy ERC20TokenRemote

Use the Deploy ERC20 Token Remote tool below:

1. Select your **L1** as the source chain
2. Enter the **NativeTokenHome address** from the previous step
3. Set the token **name** and **symbol** (e.g., "Wrapped TEST", "wTEST")
4. Set the **decimals** (should match your native token, usually 18)

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Connected to Fuji C-Chain
2. Test AVAX for gas fees
3. Your NativeTokenHome address from the previous step
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <DeployERC20TokenRemote />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Save the Contract Address

After deployment, save the **ERC20 Token Remote Address**. This is the ERC-20 token address that represents your native token on C-Chain.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Contract State After Deployment

After deployment, your ERC20TokenRemote:

- ✅ Is configured as an ERC-20 token on C-Chain
- ✅ Knows which NativeTokenHome to communicate with
- ❌ Is NOT registered with the home (transfers won't work yet)

## Next Steps

Now you need to **register the remote** with the home contract to enable bridging.
