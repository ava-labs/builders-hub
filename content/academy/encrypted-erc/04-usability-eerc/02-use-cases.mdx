The **eERC** standard can be deployed across Avalanche C-Chain **Mainnet**, **Fuji (Testnet)**, and **custom L1s**, enabling privacy in a variety of scenarios.

---

## Avalanche C-Chain
- **Private DeFi operations**: Farming, lending, and trading without exposing transaction sizes.
- **Confidential payments**: Salaries and supplier payments visible only to participants and authorized auditors.

---

## Custom L1 Deployments
- **Tokenized real-world assets (RWA)**: Privacy-enabled trading with compliance auditability.
- **Private gaming economies**: Fungible and non-fungible in-game assets with encrypted transfers.

## Step-by-Step: Private Transfer Flow (Standalone Mode)

1. **Transaction Creation**  
   - Wallet integrates.  
   - Amount is encrypted using **ElGamal** over **BabyJubJub**.  
   - A **Poseidon hash** of the ciphertext is generated for proof validation.

2. **Proof Generation**  
   - User creates a **zk-SNARK** proving the transactionâ€™s validity without revealing details.

3. **On-Chain Verification**  
   - Smart contract verifies the proof in a zk-friendly circuit optimized for BabyJubJub and Poseidon.  
   - Encrypted balances in the `EncryptedUserBalances` contract are updated.

4. **Auditor Access (Optional)**  
   - Authorized auditors can decrypt specific transactions if enabled in the **Registrar Contract**.

5. **Finalization**  
   - Transaction is recorded on Avalanche with encrypted values only.  
   - Explorers show the transfer occurred, but not the amount or updated balances.

In the **next section**, we will examine the **eERC Contracts Flow**, covering how to create an eERC, configure auditor access, choose zk-proof types, and interact with it as a user.
