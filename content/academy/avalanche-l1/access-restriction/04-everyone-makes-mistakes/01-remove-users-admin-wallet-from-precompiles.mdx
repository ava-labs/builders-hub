## Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

- Use the Console UI to manage AllowList roles
- Remove your own wallet from **Admin** on both allowlist precompiles
- Understand why this can lock you out (and why upgrades exist)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

- An L1 running with both precompiles enabled from genesis
- Your wallet currently has **Admin** role on both allowlists (from genesis)

## Instructions

import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/toolbox/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx";

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Step 1: Open the allowlist consoles

    These consoles expose the AllowList interface for the two precompiles.

    <ToolboxMdxWrapper>
      <DeployerAllowlist />
    </ToolboxMdxWrapper>

    <ToolboxMdxWrapper>
      <TransactionAllowlist />
    </ToolboxMdxWrapper>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 2: Remove your wallet from Admin on both precompiles

    For **each** precompile:

    1. Find your connected wallet address in the UI
    2. Change its role from **Admin** → **None** (or remove Admin role)
    3. Confirm the transaction in Core Wallet

    <Callout type="warning">
      Once you remove your own Admin role, you may no longer be able to grant permissions back — that’s the point of this exercise.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 3: Confirm your role is gone

    After each transaction, refresh the UI and verify `readAllowList(yourAddress)` now resolves to **None** for both precompiles.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expected Output

Your wallet no longer has Admin rights on:

- Transaction AllowList
- Contract Deployer AllowList

## Verification

To verify you've completed this exercise successfully:

1. The console UI shows your wallet has role **None** (or non-admin) on both precompiles
2. You can no longer use the UI to re-add yourself as Admin

## Troubleshooting

### I don’t see my wallet / role doesn’t update

- Make sure you’re connected to the correct L1 network in Core Wallet
- Wait for the transaction to confirm, then refresh the component

## Next Steps

Next we’ll prove you’re locked out by attempting a transaction and a contract deployment.
