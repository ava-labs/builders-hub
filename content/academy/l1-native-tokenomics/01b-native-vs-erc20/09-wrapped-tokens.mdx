Now that we understand the key differences between native tokens and ERC20s, we can explore **native token wrapping** - what it is and why it's necessary for blockchain ecosystems.

**Wrapped tokens** are blockchain assets that represent a native cryptocurrency (e.g., AVAX, ALOT, ETH) in a tokenized form, typically conforming to the **ERC-20 token standard**. Wrapping a native token allows it to be used in decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols that require ERC-20 tokens.

### What Are Wrapped Tokens?

Wrapped tokens are created through a process where the native cryptocurrency is locked in a smart contract, and an equivalent amount of the wrapped token is minted. These wrapped tokens are backed 1:1 by the underlying native asset, ensuring that the value of the wrapped token mirrors that of the original native cryptocurrency.

This **ERC-20 compatibility** is crucial for enabling the native asset to interact with dApps, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and smart contracts within the EVM ecosystem, where ERC-20 tokens are the standard. As we learned in the previous section, this solves the fundamental limitation where protocols cannot "pull" native tokens using `transferFrom()`.

### Why Are Wrapped Tokens Important?

Wrapped tokens play an essential role in **interoperability** within the EVM ecosystem, facilitating seamless use across decentralized applications and protocols. They directly address the limitations we discussed about native tokens:

- **DeFi Integration**: Wrapped tokens enable native assets to participate in DeFi protocols that require ERC-20 tokens. Remember our Aave example? Native ETH needs to be wrapped to WETH before it can be supplied to lending protocols.
- **Protocol Compatibility**: They solve the `transferFrom()` limitation by allowing protocols to "pull" tokens from user wallets, which is impossible with native tokens.
- **Liquidity**: Wrapped tokens increase liquidity in DeFi by enabling users to participate in protocols that require ERC-20 tokens, even when their original asset is a native token.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Wrapped tokens allow assets from one blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin) to be used on another chain, enhancing cross-chain functionality.

### Wrapped Token Contract Interface

A **wrapped token contract** is typically an implementation of the ERC-20 token standard, with added functions for minting and burning tokens to facilitate the wrapping and unwrapping process. Here's a basic contract interface for a wrapped token:

```solidity
interface IWrappedToken {
    function deposit() external payable;
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external;
    
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="deposit()">
This function is used to wrap native tokens. When a user calls deposit(), they send the native cryptocurrency (e.g., AVAX, ETH) to the contract, which then mints an equivalent amount of the wrapped token.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="withdraw()">
This function is used to unwrap the tokens. It burns the specified amount of wrapped tokens and returns the equivalent amount of native cryptocurrency to the user.
