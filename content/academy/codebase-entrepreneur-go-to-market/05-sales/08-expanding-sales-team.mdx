### Knowing When to Hire

Before hiring dedicated sales staff, understand your own sales process thoroughly. This knowledge helps you identify the specific skills and connections needed to complement your strengths.

Assess your personal capabilities honestly. If you excel at explaining complex concepts but struggle with cold outreach, look for someone with strong networking skills and comfort initiating conversations.

### Finding the Right Fit

The ideal first sales hire brings industry knowledge and existing relationships to your startup. Look for candidates who can initiate pilot programs with their contacts within weeks, not months.

Consider compensation structures carefully:
- A wide network of part-time referral partners may help with awareness
- 1-2 dedicated salespeople with significant time commitment are needed for consistent results
- Pure commission structures rarely provide sufficient motivation for focused effort

Balance upfront compensation with performance incentives to align interests without overwhelming your runway.
