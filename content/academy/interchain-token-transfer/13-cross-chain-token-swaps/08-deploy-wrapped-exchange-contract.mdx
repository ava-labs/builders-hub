Let's deploy our wrapper for the exchange contract on your own blockchain. 

<Steps>
<Step>
### Wrapper Deployment

While deploying the wrapped exchange contract, you will need to send two constructor arguments to the contract.

- The first argument is the wrapped native token (WAVAX) address on the destination chain (Fuji), which is: [`0xd00ae08403B9bbb9124bB305C09058E32C39A48c`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xd00ae08403B9bbb9124bB305C09058E32C39A48c).
- The second argument is the Trader Joe's (or any other Uniswap V2-like dapp) Factory V1 contract address on the destination chain (Fuji), which is: [`0xF5c7d9733e5f53abCC1695820c4818C59B457C2C`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xF5c7d9733e5f53abCC1695820c4818C59B457C2C). Deployed contracts of TraderJoe can be found [here](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/deployment-addresses/fuji).

```bash
forge create --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK --broadcast --constructor-args 0xd00ae08403B9bbb9124bB305C09058E32C39A48c 0xF5c7d9733e5f53abCC1695820c4818C59B457C2C contracts/interchain-token-transfer/cross-chain-token-swaps/DexERC20Wrapper.sol:DexERC20Wrapper
```

```
</Step>

<Step>
### Save the Wrapper Address
<Callout title="Note" type="info">
The address `0x4Ac1d98D9cEF99EC6546dEd4Bd550b0b287aaD6D` is your receiver contract address.
</Callout>

```bash
export WRAPPED_EXCHANGE_ADDRESS=...
```

In case you skipped the deployment phase mentioned on the previous page, you can use a wrapper contract, that is already deployed at [`0x38B097d95B96CD17966Cf617A71b7B20F61ba85B`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0x38B097d95B96CD17966Cf617A71b7B20F61ba85B).

```bash
export WRAPPED_EXCHANGE_ADDRESS=0x38B097d95B96CD17966Cf617A71b7B20F61ba85B
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Initiate the Cross-Chain Swap

Now that the wrapped exchange contract has been deployed, send an ERC20 token to execute a swap for WAVAX or AVAX from your Avalanche L1 to Fuji using the [`cast send`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-send) command in foundry.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url echo --private-key $PK $ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN "sendAndCall((bytes32, address, address, bytes, uint256, uint256, address, address, address, uint256, uint256), uint256)" "(${C_CHAIN_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX}, ${ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1}, ${WRAPPED_EXCHANGE_ADDRESS}, 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 2500000, 2000000, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}, ${ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN}, 0, 0)" 100000000000000000000
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Generate Payload">
The ```payload``` parameter that we sent can be generated via following JavaScript file:

```typescript
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

function encode() {

    const struct = {
        tokenOut: "0xd00ae08403B9bbb9124bB305C09058E32C39A48c",
        minAmountOut: 0
    };

    const types = ["address", "uint256"];
    const encoded = ethers.AbiCoder.defaultAbiCoder().encode(types, [ struct.tokenOut, struct.minAmountOut ]);

    console.log(encoded);

}

encode();
```
</Accordion>
</Accordions>
</Step>

<Step>
### Verify the Results

To verify that your cross-chain swap was successful, you'll need to check the balance of your address on the destination chain (Fuji). You can use Foundry's cast command to check both native AVAX and WAVAX balances.

**Check WAVAX Balance**: Since the swap involves WAVAX (the wrapped version of AVAX), use the following command to check the WAVAX token balance:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url local-c 0xd00ae08403B9bbb9124bB305C09058E32C39A48c "balanceOf(address)" ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}
```

This calls the `balanceOf` function on the WAVAX token contract to check your balance.

**Check Native AVAX Balance**: If you chose to receive native AVAX instead of WAVAX, check your native balance:

```bash
cast balance --rpc-url local-c ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}
```

```bash
cast balance --rpc-url local-c ${FUNDED_ADDRESS} --ether
```
</Step>
</Steps>
