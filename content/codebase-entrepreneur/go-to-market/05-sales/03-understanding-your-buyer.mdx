### Understanding Your Buyer

Before approaching potential customers, create a specific list of the people to whom your solution applies. For B2B sales, identify exact job titles (CMOs, marketing managers, CFOs) who would benefit from your product.

Consider the different motivations between buyers and users. In enterprise settings, the person purchasing your product often differs from the person using it daily. A pitch about replacing manual processes might appeal to a VP but concern the analyst whose job could be affected.

Map all stakeholders involved in purchasing decisions, especially for enterprise sales. Understanding the complete decision-making chain helps you tailor your approach to address concerns at every level.

### Building Early Traction

Even before your product is complete, start using it publicly and sharing results. Create case studies that demonstrate how your technology transforms businesses. Analyze existing companies in your target market and show the potential impact of your solution.

This approach serves two purposes: it showcases your expertise and begins generating interest before you've made your first actual sale.
