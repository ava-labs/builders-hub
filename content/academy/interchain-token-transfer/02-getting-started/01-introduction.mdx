# Getting Started with Interchain Token Transfer

In this section, we'll help you get started with our Interchain Token Transfer toolbox. We've made it easier than ever to transfer assets across Avalanche chains by providing a user-friendly interface that handles all the complexity for you.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. A modern web browser with Core Wallet installed
   - Download Core Wallet from [core.app](https://core.app)
   - Create or import your wallet
   - Add the following testnet chains to your wallet:
     - Fuji C-Chain****
     - Echo
     - Dispatch

2. Test tokens for development
   - Get test AVAX from the [Avalanche Faucet](https://faucet.avax.network)
   - For other test tokens, visit the [Avalanche Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.avax-test.network)

3. Basic understanding of how to use Core Wallet
   - Adding networks
   - Managing accounts
   - Approving transactions

4. An understanding of Avalanche networks and how to connect to them

<Callout type="warning">
This course focuses on using the existing testnet chains (Fuji C-Chain, Echo, and Dispatch). If you want to create your own L1 blockchain, please refer to the [Creating an L1](/academy/avalanche-fundamentals/04-creating-an-l1/01-creating-an-l1) course.

Since Interchain Token Transfer relies on Interchain Messaging (ICM), you must run your own relayer to enable cross-chain communication. Follow the [Running a Relayer](/academy/interchain-messaging/10-running-a-relayer/01-running-a-relayer) course to set up your relayer.

## Using the Interchain Token Transfer Toolbox

Our Interchain Token Transfer toolbox is a comprehensive web application that provides a complete suite of tools for cross-chain operations. Here's how to get started:

1. Visit the [Interchain Token Transfer Toolbox](https://toolbox.avax.network/interchain-transfer)

2. Connect your wallet:
   - Click the "Connect Wallet" button
   - Select Core Wallet
   - Approve the connection request

3. Explore the toolbox features:

   a. Deploy Contracts:
   - Deploy new ERC-20 tokens
   - Create bridge contracts
   - Set up token bridges

   b. Transfer Assets:
   - Select the source and destination chains (Fuji C-Chain, Echo, or Dispatch)
   - Choose the token and amount
   - Execute cross-chain transfers

   c. Test Transfers:
   - Use the test transfer feature to verify your setup
   - Monitor transfer status
   - View transaction history

## Features

Our toolbox provides several features to help you with cross-chain operations:

- Contract Deployment:
  - ERC-20 token deployment
  - Bridge contract creation
  - Token bridge setup

- Asset Transfers:
  - Support for testnet chains (Fuji C-Chain, Echo, Dispatch)
  - ERC-20 token transfers
  - Native token transfers
  - Cross-chain token swaps

- Testing and Monitoring:
  - Test transfer functionality
  - Transaction history
  - Real-time status updates
  - Cross-chain transaction tracking

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to use the Interchain Token Transfer toolbox, you can:

1. Learn about different token types in the next section
2. Explore token bridging concepts
3. Try out different types of cross-chain transfers
4. Deploy your own tokens and bridges
5. Test your cross-chain setup

Remember that our toolbox handles all the complex interactions with the Interchain Token Transfer protocol, so you can focus on your cross-chain operations without worrying about the technical details.
