1. **Start with a security mindset**: Build security into your project from day one rather than trying to add it later.

2. **Focus on fundamentals first**: Implement strong access management, change management, and vendor management practices before investing in expensive security tools.

3. **Protect cryptographic keys rigorously**: Follow the Cryptocurrency Security Standard, use HSMs when possible, and implement multi-signature approval processes.

4. **Be strategic about data storage**: Make deliberate decisions about what goes on-chain versus off-chain based on immutability needs, cost considerations, and privacy requirements.

5. **Plan for evolution**: Design your systems to allow for future changes in your security and data architecture as your project grows and technology advances.
