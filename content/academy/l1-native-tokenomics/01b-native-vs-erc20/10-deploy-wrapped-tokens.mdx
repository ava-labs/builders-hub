#### 1. Deploy Wrapped Native Token with the Dev Console
Use the Dev Console to easily deploy a wrapped native token without any setup or command line tools.

The Dev Console provides a simple interface to deploy wrapped native tokens directly from your browser. This eliminates the need to:
- Set up a local development environment
- Install and configure Foundry
- Manage private keys manually
- Write deployment scripts

You can deploy a wrapped native token in just a few clicks using the integrated deployment tool below.

  <DeployWrappedNative />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

### Note Your Wrapped Token Address

After deployment, the Dev Console will display your wrapped token address. You can copy this address for use in other tools and interactions. The address will be automatically saved in the Dev Console session for easy reference across different tools.

### Interacting with Your Wrapped Token

Once deployed, you can interact with your wrapped native token using various methods:

**Using the Dev Console:**
- The Dev Console provides additional tools for interacting with ERC-20 tokens
- Look for token interaction tools in the ICTT section
- These tools provide a user-friendly interface without requiring command-line knowledge

**Using Wallets:**
- Import the token address into MetaMask or other EVM-compatible wallets
- The wrapped token will appear as a standard ERC-20 token
- You can send, receive, and view balances directly in your wallet

**Key Functions:**
- **Deposit/Wrap**: Convert native tokens to wrapped tokens (increases your wrapped token balance)
- **Withdraw/Unwrap**: Convert wrapped tokens back to native tokens (decreases your wrapped token balance)

The wrapped token maintains a 1:1 ratio with the native token, making it perfect for DeFi integrations and cross-chain applications.
