## Overview

So far, you enabled **Transaction AllowList** and **Contract Deployer AllowList** in genesis using a BuilderHub hosted node. In a real network, you won't always get the genesis config "perfect" on day one, and you may need to **turn precompiles on/off** (or change their parameters) later.

Subnet-EVM supports doing this via **network upgrades** using an `upgrade.json` file. In this section, you'll:

1. **Set up a Docker validator** (required to access config files)
2. **Disable** both allowlist precompiles via `upgrade.json`
3. Restart the node and verify the precompiles are no longer available

<Callout type="info">
**Why Docker?** BuilderHub hosted nodes don't allow direct access to configuration files. To perform network upgrades, you need to run your own validator with full filesystem access.
</Callout>

## Key Concepts

- **Network upgrades** change how blocks are processed. All validators must upgrade consistently, or the chain can halt or fall out of sync.
- **Upgrade file location**: `{chain-config-dir}/{blockchainID}/upgrade.json`
- **Timestamps must be in the future** (relative to the chain head). Past timestamps will cause the node to fail on startup.
- **Upgrade lists are append-only** — you can only add new entries, not modify or remove existing ones.
- **Disabling a precompile** prevents all calls and clears its storage, allowing it to be re-enabled later with fresh configuration.
