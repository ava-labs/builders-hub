# Bridge USDC to Native Tokens

With your bridge fully configured and collateralized, you can now transfer your **1 USDC** from Fuji to your L1, where it becomes **native gas tokens**.

<Callout type="info">
**Reminder**: You received 1 USDC from the [Circle Faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/) at the start of this chapter.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect to Fuji C-Chain

Switch your wallet to **Fuji C-Chain** (the source chain).

Verify you have:
- **1 USDC** (from Circle faucet)
- **Test AVAX** for gas fees

</Step>

<Step>
### Bridge using the Token Transfer tool

Use the tool below to bridge your USDC:

1. Select your **ERC20TokenHome** as the source bridge contract
2. Select your **NativeTokenRemote** as the destination bridge contract
3. Enter **1** as the amount (or less if you want to keep some USDC)

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Successfully registered and collateralized your bridge
2. USDC tokens in your wallet
3. AVAX for gas fees on Fuji
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <TestSend />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Switch to your L1 and confirm

Switch your wallet to **your L1** and check your native token balance.

You should now have native tokens on your L1! These are backed 1:1 by the USDC locked in the ERC20TokenHome on Fuji.

</Step>
</Steps>

## What Happened

1. Your **1 USDC** was **locked** in the ERC20TokenHome on Fuji
2. An ICM message was sent to your L1 via the relayer
3. NativeTokenRemote called the **Native Minter precompile** to mint native tokens
4. **1 native token** was credited to your address on your L1

## Bridging Back

To bridge native tokens back to USDC:

1. Switch to your L1
2. Use the Token Transfer tool with reversed source/destination
3. Native tokens will be burned and USDC released on Fuji

## Summary

You've successfully:

- Got 1 USDC from the Circle faucet
- Created an L1 with Native Minter enabled
- Deployed ERC20TokenHome on Fuji for USDC
- Deployed NativeTokenRemote on your L1
- Registered and collateralized the bridge
- Bridged 1 USDC → 1 native token

Your L1 now uses **USDC as the native gas token**!

## Next Chapter

In Chapter 2, you'll learn the reverse: exporting your L1's native token to C-Chain as an ERC-20.
