Avalanche L1s ship multiple default precompiles that need access control, this is done via the same audited permission interface: the **AllowList interface**.

### Permission levels

The roles are:

- **Admin**: can manage all roles (Admin, Manager, Enabled).
- **Manager**: can manage Enabled addresses only.
- **Enabled**: can use the precompile’s functionality (what that means depends on the specific precompile).
- **None**: no access.

This is a *role-based access control* pattern, implemented consistently across precompiles that opt into it.

## AllowList interface

This interface exposes a small set of functions to manage roles for addresses:

### Functions

- `setAdmin(address addr)`: give `addr` **Admin** role.
- `setManager(address addr)`: give `addr` **Manager** role.
- `setEnabled(address addr)`: give `addr` **Enabled** role.
- `setNone(address addr)`: remove any role from `addr` (back to **None**).
- `readAllowList(address addr) -> uint256`: read the current role value.


## Precompiles that use AllowList

Several default Avalanche L1 precompiles implement this interface (examples):

- [Deployer AllowList](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/deployer-allowlist)
- [Transaction AllowList](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/transaction-allowlist)
- [Native Minter](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/native-minter)
- [Fee Manager](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/fee-manager)
- [Reward Manager](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/reward-manager)
