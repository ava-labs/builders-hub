## Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

- Create an Avalanche L1 with a custom genesis configuration
- Enable **Transaction AllowList** and **Contract Deployer AllowList** at genesis
- Launch a BuilderHub hosted node and connect Core Wallet to your L1

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

- [BuilderHub account](https://build.avax.network/login) (create one if needed)
- [Core Wallet](https://core.app) installed and set to the correct network mode
- A funded wallet (testnet AVAX) to create the Subnet + Chain transactions - get tokens from the [Console Faucet](/console/primary-network/faucet)

## Instructions

import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';
import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/toolbox/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx";
import CreateChain from "@/components/toolbox/console/layer-1/create/CreateChain";
import CreateManagedTestnetNode from "@/components/toolbox/console/testnet-infra/ManagedTestnetNodes/CreateManagedTestnetNode";
import ConvertSubnetToL1 from "@/components/toolbox/console/layer-1/create/ConvertSubnetToL1";

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Step 1: Create the Subnet and Chain

    Use Builder Console to create the Subnet and then create your chain. 

    **Important**: In the **Precompiles** section, enable both allowlist precompiles under **Permissioning**:
    - Transaction AllowList
    - Contract Deployer AllowList

    Your connected wallet will be automatically assigned the **Admin** role for both.

    <ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
      <CreateChain embedded={true} />
    </ToolboxMdxWrapper>

    <Callout type="info">
    Save your **Subnet ID**, **Blockchain ID**, and **Chain ID** after creation. You'll need these later.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 2: Launch a BuilderHub Hosted Node

    Start a managed node for your L1 (no Docker required for this step):

    <ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="testnet-mainnet">
      <CreateManagedTestnetNode />
    </ToolboxMdxWrapper>

    Wait until the node is healthy and your chain is producing blocks.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 3: Convert Subnet to L1

    Convert your Subnet into a sovereign L1:

    <Callout type="warning">
    This conversion is **irreversible**. Double-check you're converting the correct Subnet.
    </Callout>

    <ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
      <ConvertSubnetToL1 />
    </ToolboxMdxWrapper>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expected Output

You should have:

- A running L1 with a BuilderHub hosted node
- Core Wallet connected to your L1
- Both allowlist precompiles enabled from genesis

## What's Next

In the next lessons, you'll:

1. Test the allowlist precompiles using the Builder Console
2. Intentionally remove yourself from the admin list to experience the restriction
3. Learn how to recover using network upgrades (which will require setting up a Docker validator)

<Callout type="info">
**Note**: Later in this course, you'll need to run your own Docker-hosted validator to perform network upgrades. BuilderHub hosted nodes don't allow direct config file access. We'll set that up when needed.
</Callout>
