## Overview

0xGasless AgentKit is an SDK that provides on‑chain execution for AI agents, enabling them to sign transactions, interact with smart contracts, swap tokens, deploy contracts, and manage wallets without gas.

It also includes a complete account abstraction stack on ERC-4337 and ERC-7702, allowing developers to build seamless, user-friendly dApps with features like gasless transactions, batching, and session keys.

## What we are offering

0xGasless is an Account Abstraction platform and AI AgentKit enabling gasless smart accounts and autonomous on‑chain AI agents via ERC‑4337, with paymasters, bundlers, and LLM‑ready tools across EVM chains.

### AA SDK

- Bundler-as-a-Service
- Paymaster-as-a-Service
- ERC-4337 Smart Wallets
- ERC-7702

### AgentKit

- Open-source [GitHub repo](https://github.com/0xgasless/agentkit) 
- [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0xgasless/agentkit) 
- 0xGasless Claude MCP: [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0xgasless/mcp) & [Github Repo](https://github.com/0xgasless/mcp)

## C‑Chain (Avalanche) notes:

- **Native gas token**: AVAX (sponsored mode requires a funded paymaster).
- Many stablecoins (e.g., USDT) use 6 decimals, format amounts correctly.
- Ensure your API key is enabled for 43114 and that your paymaster gas tank is funded.
