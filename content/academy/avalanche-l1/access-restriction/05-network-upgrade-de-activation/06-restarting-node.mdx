## Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

- Restart the Docker validator container safely.
- Confirm (via logs) that the node loaded your `UpgradeConfig`.
- Recognize and fix the common “timestamp is in the past” startup failure.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

- Created `upgrade.json` with disable entries in:
  - `~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/<YOUR_BLOCKCHAIN_ID>/upgrade.json`
- Access to a terminal on the Docker host (to run `docker` commands).

## Instructions

import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Step 1: Exit the container shell (if needed)

    If you’re currently inside the container shell, exit back to your host terminal:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 2: Restart the validator container

    Restart the container so AvalancheGo reloads configuration files:

    ```bash
    docker restart <YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID>
    ```

    Then follow the logs as it starts back up:

    ```bash
    docker logs -f <YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 3: Confirm the upgrade config was loaded

    On startup, Subnet-EVM prints the chain configuration. You’re looking for log output that includes an `UpgradeConfig` / `precompileUpgrades` section containing your two disable entries.

    <Callout type="info">
    If you don’t see the upgrade config reflected in logs, double-check you created `upgrade.json` in the correct directory: it must be next to `config.json` inside `~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/<YOUR_BLOCKCHAIN_ID>/`.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expected Output

Your node restarts successfully and logs show it parsed an `UpgradeConfig` that includes your disable upgrades.

```
... Initialised chain configuration ... UpgradeConfig: {"precompileUpgrades":[ ... ]}
```

## Verification

To verify you've completed this exercise successfully:

1. The container is running (`docker ps` shows it up).
2. The logs include your `precompileUpgrades` entries.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: The node fails on startup after adding the upgrade

**Problem**: A common cause is a `blockTimestamp` being **in the past** relative to chain head.

**Solution**:
- Update the timestamps to a larger value (e.g., `now + 10 minutes`) and restart again.
- Keep the two upgrades in increasing timestamp order.

## Next Steps

Next, you’ll verify in the Builder Console that the Transaction/Deployer allowlist precompiles are no longer available.
