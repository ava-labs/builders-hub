# Bridge Native Tokens

With your bridge fully configured, you can now transfer native tokens from **Fuji C-Chain** to **Echo**, where they’ll appear as an **ERC-20**.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Step 1: Connect to Fuji C-Chain

Switch your wallet to **Fuji C-Chain** (the source chain).

<Callout type="info">
You need **test AVAX** on Fuji for the amount you want to bridge **plus gas**.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Step 2: Bridge using the Console transfer tool

Use the **Token Transfer** tool below to initiate the cross-chain transfer. When the transfer completes, the tool will display a **success message** (including transaction/message details).

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Successfully registered your remote bridge
2. Native tokens (AVAX) in your wallet to bridge
3. Additional AVAX for gas fees
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <TestSend />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Step 3: Switch to Echo and confirm the bridged balance

Switch your wallet to **Echo** (destination chain) and confirm your balance increased.

<Callout type="info">
Echo is already added by default in Core Wallet in this course flow, so you shouldn’t need to manually add the network.
</Callout>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Next you’ll do the other native-token flow: **Native → Native**, where the bridged asset becomes the destination chain’s **native gas token** (requires collateral).
