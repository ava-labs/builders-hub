In Web3, the relationship between builders and users is fundamentally different from Web2 . The decentralized nature of blockchain projects means users often have multiple roles—they might be customers, token holders, and governance participants simultaneously.

This creates both challenges and opportunities. While managing these overlapping personas requires careful attention, it also creates powerful alignment incentives when done correctly.

The community-driven nature of Web3 projects means founders must spend significantly more time on outbound customer discovery, especially in the early stages. This is because user feedback doesn't just inform product development; it often shapes governance and tokenomics as well.
