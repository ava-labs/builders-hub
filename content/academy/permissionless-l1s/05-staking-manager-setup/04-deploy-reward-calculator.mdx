The **Reward Calculator** determines how staking rewards are distributed based on validator uptime and delegation amounts.

## What is the Reward Calculator?

The Reward Calculator contract:
- Calculates rewards based on validator uptime percentage
- Determines delegation fee distribution
- Implements the `IRewardCalculator` interface
- Can be customized for different reward mechanisms

## Deploy the Contract

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="l1">
    <DeployExampleRewardCalculator />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## Next Steps

After deploying the Reward Calculator, you'll initialize the Staking Manager with the necessary configuration parameters.
