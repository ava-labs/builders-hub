## Automated Testnet Tokens (Recommended)

The easiest way to get testnet AVAX is through [Builder Hub](https://hub.avax.network):

1. **Create a Builder Hub account** (free)
2. **Connect your Core wallet** to Builder Hub
3. **Tokens are automatically sent** to your wallet on C-Chain, P-Chain, and supported L1s

No coupon codes, no manual claims - just connect and go! This automated drip system ensures you always have enough testnet tokens for development.

## Alternative: External Faucet

If you prefer not to create a Builder Hub account, you can use the [Fuji Testnet Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/). (This testnet AVAX has no value.)

Paste your address into the [Fuji faucet website](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/):

If you already have an AVAX balance greater than zero on Mainnet, paste your C-Chain address there, and request test tokens. The faucet will send some AVAX to the address and return a transaction ID (txID).

Otherwise, please request a faucet coupon on [Guild](https://guild.xyz/avalanche). Admins and mods on the official [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RwXY7P6) can provide testnet AVAX if developers are unable to obtain it from the other options.
