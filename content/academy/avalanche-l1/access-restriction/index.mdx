## Access Restriction

Access restriction is a core requirement for many real-world networks: you may need to control **who can submit transactions** and **who can deploy contracts** to meet operational, institutional, and compliance needs.

In Avalanche L1s, these controls are implemented as **precompiles** (go code wrapped in a solidity interface) that follow a shared, audited permission model: the **AllowList interface**.

## Course Structure

This course is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Fundamentals

The first section covers the basics of access restriction precompiles:

- **Introduction** — What precompiles are, the AllowList permission model (Admin/Manager/Enabled), and real-world use cases
- **Genesis Activation** — Create an L1 with **Transaction AllowList** and **Contract Deployer AllowList** enabled from genesis, then test that permissions work as expected

### Part 2: Advanced Topics

The second section dives deeper into precompile internals and recovery patterns:

- **Precompile Flow (Optional)** — Understand how Solidity calls route to Go code, and how the blockchain automatically enforces permissions even when you're not directly calling the precompile
- **User Error** — Intentionally lock yourself out by removing your admin privileges, then observe the resulting failures
- **Network Upgrades** — Learn how to **deactivate** and **reactivate** precompiles via `upgrade.json` to recover from misconfigurations (requires a self-hosted Docker validator)

<Callout type="info">
Part 1 uses a **BuilderHub hosted node** for quick setup. Part 2 (Advanced) requires running your own **Docker validator** to access configuration files for network upgrades.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, we recommend completing:

- [Customizing the EVM](/academy/avalanche-l1/customizing-evm) — especially the **Precompiles** section
- Comfort using **Core Wallet**, **Docker**, and reading a **genesis JSON**

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand what precompiles are and leverage them to implement privileged network features
- Enable **Transaction AllowList** and **Contract Deployer AllowList** in genesis
- **Activate** and **Deactivate** precompiles via **Network Upgrades**
