title: Transaction Fees & Validator Rewards
description: Configure fee parameters and reward mechanisms for your Avalanche L1 blockchain.
---

## Overview

The Subnet-EVM provides two powerful precompiles for managing transaction fees and rewards:

- **Fee Manager**: Configure dynamic fee parameters and gas costs
- **Reward Manager**: Control how transaction fees are distributed or burned

Both precompiles use the [AllowList interface](/docs/avalanche-l1s/allowlist) to restrict access to their functionality.

## Fee Manager

### Purpose
The Fee Manager allows you to configure the parameters of the dynamic fee algorithm on-chain. This gives you control over:

- Gas limits and target block rates
- Base fee parameters
- Block gas cost parameters

### Configuration
Located at address `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000003`, you can activate this precompile in your genesis file:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "feeManagerConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"],
      "initialFeeConfig": {
        "gasLimit": 20000000,
        "targetBlockRate": 2,
        "minBaseFee": 1000000000,
        "targetGas": 100000000,
        "baseFeeChangeDenominator": 48,
        "minBlockGasCost": 0,
        "maxBlockGasCost": 10000000,
        "blockGasCostStep": 500000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Fee Parameters

The Fee Manager allows configuration of the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Recommended Range |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| gasLimit | Maximum gas allowed per block | 8M - 100M |
| targetBlockRate | Target time between blocks (seconds) | 2 - 10 |
| minBaseFee | Minimum base fee (in wei) | 25 - 500 gwei |
| targetGas | Target gas usage per block | 5M - 50M |
| baseFeeChangeDenominator | Controls how quickly base fee changes | 8 - 1000 |
| minBlockGasCost | Minimum gas cost for a block | 0 - 1B |
| maxBlockGasCost | Maximum gas cost for a block | > minBlockGasCost |
| blockGasCostStep | How quickly block gas cost changes | < 5M |

### Access Control and Additional Features

The FeeManager precompile uses the [AllowList interface](/docs/avalanche-l1s/allowlist) to restrict access to its functionality.

In addition to the AllowList interface, the FeeManager adds the following capabilities:

- `getFeeConfig`: retrieves the current dynamic fee config
- `getFeeConfigLastChangedAt`: retrieves the timestamp of the last block where the fee config was updated
- `setFeeConfig`: sets the dynamic fee config on chain. This function can only be called by an Admin, Manager or Enabled address.
- `FeeConfigChanged`: an event that is emitted when the fee config is updated. Topics include the sender, the old fee config, and the new fee config.

You can also get the fee configuration at a block with the `eth_feeConfig` RPC method. For more information see [here](/docs/api-reference/subnet-evm-api#eth_feeconfig).

## Reward Manager

### Purpose
The Reward Manager allows you to control how transaction fees are handled in your network. You can:

- Send fees to a specific address (e.g., treasury)
- Allow validators to collect fees
- Burn fees entirely

### Configuration
Located at address `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000004`, you can activate this precompile in your genesis file:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "rewardManagerConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"],
      "initialRewardConfig": {
        // Choose one of:
        "allowFeeRecipients": true,  // Allow validators to collect fees
        "rewardAddress": "0x...",    // Send fees to specific address
        // Empty config = burn fees
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Reward Mechanisms

The Reward Manager supports three mutually exclusive mechanisms:

1. **Validator Fee Collection** (`allowFeeRecipients`)
   - Validators can specify their own fee recipient addresses
   - Fees go to the block producer's chosen address
   - Good for incentivizing network participation

2. **Fixed Reward Address** (`rewardAddress`)
   - All fees go to a single specified address
   - Can be a contract or EOA
   - Useful for treasury or DAO-controlled fee collection

3. **Fee Burning** (default)
   - All transaction fees are burned
   - Reduces total token supply over time
   - Similar to Ethereum's EIP-1559

## Implementation

### Fee Manager Interface

```solidity
interface IFeeManager {
  struct FeeConfig {
    uint256 gasLimit;
    uint256 targetBlockRate;
    uint256 minBaseFee;
    uint256 targetGas;
    uint256 baseFeeChangeDenominator;
    uint256 minBlockGasCost;
    uint256 maxBlockGasCost;
    uint256 blockGasCostStep;
  }
  
  event FeeConfigChanged(address indexed sender, FeeConfig oldFeeConfig, FeeConfig newFeeConfig);

  function setFeeConfig(
    uint256 gasLimit,
    uint256 targetBlockRate,
    uint256 minBaseFee,
    uint256 targetGas,
    uint256 baseFeeChangeDenominator,
    uint256 minBlockGasCost,
    uint256 maxBlockGasCost,
    uint256 blockGasCostStep
  ) external;

  function getFeeConfig() external view returns (
    uint256 gasLimit,
    uint256 targetBlockRate,
    uint256 minBaseFee,
    uint256 targetGas,
    uint256 baseFeeChangeDenominator,
    uint256 minBlockGasCost,
    uint256 maxBlockGasCost,
    uint256 blockGasCostStep
  );

  function getFeeConfigLastChangedAt() external view returns (uint256 blockNumber);
}
```

### Reward Manager Interface

```solidity
interface IRewardManager {
  event RewardAddressChanged(
    address indexed sender,
    address indexed oldRewardAddress,
    address indexed newRewardAddress
  );
  event FeeRecipientsAllowed(address indexed sender);
  event RewardsDisabled(address indexed sender);

  function setRewardAddress(address addr) external;
  function allowFeeRecipients() external;
  function disableRewards() external;
  function currentRewardAddress() external view returns (address rewardAddress);
  function areFeeRecipientsAllowed() external view returns (bool isAllowed);
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Reward Management**:
   - Choose reward mechanism based on network goals
   - Consider using a multi-sig or DAO as reward address
   - Monitor fee collection and distribution
   - Keep documentation of fee policy changes

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - Use multi-sig for admin addresses
   - Test fee changes on testnet first
   - Monitor events for unauthorized changes
   - Have a plan for fee parameter adjustments
