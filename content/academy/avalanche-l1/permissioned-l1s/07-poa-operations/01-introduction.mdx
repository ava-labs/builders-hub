This chapter covers how to perform validator operations through your new multi-sig governance structure. The core operations (add, change weight, remove) are the same as before, but the flow now involves multi-sig approval.

## Key Difference: Multi-Sig Approval

In the previous chapter on [Validator Manager Operations](/academy/permissioned-l1s/05-validator-manager-operations/01-introduction), you performed operations directly from your EOA:

<Mermaid

    participant EOA as Your Wallet
    participant VM as Validator Manager
    participant PC as P-Chain

    EOA->>VM: initiateValidatorRegistration()
    VM->>PC: Warp Message
    PC-->>VM: Confirmation
    EOA->>VM: completeValidatorRegistration()
"
/>

With the multi-sig setup, the flow now includes Safe wallet approval:

<Mermaid

    participant S1 as Signer 1
    participant S2 as Signer 2
    participant Safe as Safe Wallet
    participant PoA as PoA Manager
    participant VM as Validator Manager
    participant PC as P-Chain

    S1->>Safe: Propose operation
    S2->>Safe: Approve operation
    Safe->>PoA: Execute approved tx
    PoA->>VM: initiateValidatorRegistration()
    VM->>PC: Warp Message
    PC-->>VM: Confirmation
    Note over Safe,VM: Complete phase follows same pattern

## Operations Overview

| Operation | Phases | Multi-Sig Approvals Needed |
|-----------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Add Validator** | Initiate + Complete | 2 (one per phase) |
| **Change Weight** | Initiate + Complete | 2 (one per phase) |
| **Remove Validator** | Initiate + Complete | 2 (one per phase) |

<Callout type="info">
Each phase requires a separate multi-sig transaction. Plan accordingly when coordinating with your signers.
</Callout>

## The Two-Phase Pattern

All validator operations follow the same two-phase pattern:

### Phase 1: Initiation

1. **Propose in Safe**: A signer creates a transaction proposal in the Safe wallet
2. **Collect Approvals**: Other signers review and approve the transaction
3. **Execute**: Once threshold is met, execute the transaction
4. **Warp Message Sent**: The Validator Manager sends a message to P-Chain

### Phase 2: Completion

1. **Wait for P-Chain**: The P-Chain processes the request and signs a response
2. **Propose Completion**: A signer proposes the completion transaction in Safe
3. **Collect Approvals**: Other signers approve the completion
4. **Execute**: Complete the operation on the Validator Manager

## Working with Safe

For each operation in this chapter, you'll:

1. **Access your Safe wallet**: Go to [wallet.ash.center](https://wallet.ash.center/)
2. **Create a new transaction**: Use the transaction builder or direct contract interaction
3. **Set the target**: Your PoA Manager address
4. **Build the calldata**: For the specific operation you want to perform
5. **Submit and sign**: Initiate the approval process
6. **Coordinate approvals**: Get other signers to approve
7. **Execute**: Once threshold is reached, execute the transaction

<Callout type="warning">
**Coordination Required**: Unlike EOA operations that you can do instantly, multi-sig operations require coordinating with other signers. Plan ahead for validator changes.
</Callout>

## What You'll Learn

In the following sections, you'll practice:

1. **Adding a Validator**: Propose and execute a validator addition through Safe
2. **Changing Weight**: Modify a validator's influence via multi-sig
3. **Removing a Validator**: Safely remove a validator with proper approvals

Each section will guide you through the Safe interface and the specific steps needed for that operation.
