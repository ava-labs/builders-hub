## Beyond Funding: Maximizing Foundation Support

Successful grantees emphasize that the financial aspect is just one part of the value. The Avalanche Foundation offers extensive support beyond funding:

- Business development connections within and outside the ecosystem
- Co-marketing and visibility opportunities
- Technical support from the developer relations team
- Credibility boost for fundraising and partnerships
- Access to a large, engaged early adopter community

QUOTE CARD: “We don't just want to fund projects. We want to fund ecosystem participants. We want developers to collaborate with each other, we want them to be active and engaged on Telegram groups with other builders. We want them to be just essentially part of the community." - Daniel Ortiz, Senior Program Manager at Avalanche Foundation
