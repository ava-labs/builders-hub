Now that you have Core wallet set up and some AVAX on the P-Chain you can create a Subnet. You will
do this by issuing a `CreateSubnetTx` transaction. This will create a Subnet that is uniquely
identified by the transaction hash of the `CreateSubnetTx` transaction.

Then you will issue the `CreateChainTx` on the P-Chain to create the blockchain record. Click
`Create Chain` This will create the P-Chain record for your blockchain and associate it with the
Subnet created in the previous step. 

The blockchain will be uniquely identified by the transaction hash of the `CreateChainTx` transaction.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a blockchain record on the P-Chain. The blockchain does not
have any validator nodes yet, so we can't connect our wallet to it or issue any transactions just
yet. You will learn how to do that in the next section.
