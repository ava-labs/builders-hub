Now that we've gone over what Avalanche L1s are, you are probably eager to test out the functionality of Avalanche L1s by creating one yourself!

There are many ways to create an L1 on Avalanche. In this section, you will learn how to create a
blockchain using the the Avalanche Builder Tooling. Of course there are many other ways to create a
blockchain on Avalanche, such as using Avalanche CLI or using a [Blockchain-as-a-Service Provider](/integrations#Blockchain%20as%20a%20Service).

## What You Will Learn

In this section, you will go through the following steps:

<Steps>
<Step>

### Claim Testnet AVAX Tokens

Download the Core chrome extension and claim some testnet AVAX tokens from the faucet.

</Step>
<Step>

### Bridge AVAX from the C-Chain to the P-Chain

Bridge your the AVAX you have just claimed to the P-Chain.

</Step>
<Step>

### Create a Subnet

Issue a `CreateSubnetTx` transaction on the P-Chain to create a Subnet record.

</Step>
<Step>

### Create a Blockchain
Add a Blockchain to the Subnet by issuing a `CreateChainTx` transaction on the P-Chain.

</Step>
<Step>

### Launch a Validator for that Blockchain

Set up a node with Docker tracking that Subnet. 

</Step>
<Step>

### Convert to an L1

Convert the Subnet to an L1 by issuing a `ConvertSubnetToL1Tx` transaction on the P-Chain. This will
turn your node into an actual validator for the L1.
