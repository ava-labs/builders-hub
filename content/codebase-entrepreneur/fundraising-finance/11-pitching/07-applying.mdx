To apply these storytelling principles to your Web3 startup:

1. **Audit your current pitch deck**: Remove unnecessary technical details, reduce text on slides, and ensure each slide serves as a visual cue rather than an information dump.

2. **Craft your opening**: Write a one-sentence description of your company that covers identity, impact, and vision. Test it with both technical and non-technical listeners.

3. **Choose your narrative framework**: Decide whether Hero's Journey, Bridge Story, or Twist Ending best fits your startup's situation and adapt your pitch accordingly.

4. **Practice translating technical concepts**: Take your most complex protocol or feature and explain it to someone with no blockchain knowledge using the metaphor framework.

5. **Document your Context, Content, and Climb**: Map out your market positioning, user journey, and both short and long-term projections.

6. **Prepare your anchoring process**: For each section of your pitch, identify the key concept, personal connection, and appropriate energy level.

7. **Review yourself**: Practice your pitch on camera, then watch it with the sound off (for body language) and listen with your eyes closed (for vocal delivery). If you don't like recording yourself, you can do this same exercise in front of a friend and ask for feedback.

8. **Develop a Q&A preparation document**: List potential questions from different stakeholder perspectives and craft concise, confident answers.
