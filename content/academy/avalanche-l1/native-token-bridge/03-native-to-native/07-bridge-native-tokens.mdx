# Bridge AVAX to Native Tokens

With your bridge fully configured and collateralized, you can now transfer AVAX from Fuji to your L1, where it becomes **native gas tokens**.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect to Fuji C-Chain

Switch your wallet to **Fuji C-Chain** (the source chain).

<Callout type="info">
You need **AVAX** on Fuji for the amount you want to bridge, **plus additional AVAX** for gas.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Bridge using the Token Transfer tool

Use the tool below to initiate the cross-chain transfer:

1. Select your **NativeTokenHome** as the source bridge contract
2. Select your **NativeTokenRemote** as the destination bridge contract
3. Enter the amount of AVAX to bridge

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Successfully registered and collateralized your bridge
2. AVAX in your wallet to bridge
3. Additional AVAX for gas fees on Fuji
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <TestSend />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Switch to your L1 and confirm

Switch your wallet to **your L1** and confirm your native token balance increased.

The bridged AVAX is now usable as **native gas tokens** on your L1!

</Step>
</Steps>

## What Happened

1. AVAX was **wrapped to WAVAX** and locked in the NativeTokenHome on Fuji
2. An ICM message was sent to your L1 via the relayer
3. NativeTokenRemote called the **Native Minter precompile** to mint native tokens
4. Native tokens were credited to your address

## Bridging Back

To bridge native tokens back to AVAX:

1. Switch to your L1
2. Use the Token Transfer tool with reversed source/destination
3. Native tokens will be burned and AVAX released on Fuji

## Summary

You've successfully:

- ✅ Created an L1 with AVAX as the native gas token
- ✅ Deployed NativeTokenHome on Fuji
- ✅ Deployed NativeTokenRemote on your L1
- ✅ Collateralized the bridge
- ✅ Bridged AVAX → Native tokens

## Course Complete!

You've now learned both native-token bridging patterns:

| Pattern | Source Token | Home Contract | Remote Contract | Result |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| ERC-20 → Native | USDC | ERC20TokenHome | NativeTokenRemote | USDC becomes gas token |
| Native → Native | AVAX | NativeTokenHome | NativeTokenRemote | AVAX becomes gas token |

Both patterns require the **Native Minter precompile** and **collateralization** on the destination L1.
