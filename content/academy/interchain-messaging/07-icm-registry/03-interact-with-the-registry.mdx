The ICM Registry is already deployed on Fuji C-Chain, Dispatch, and Echo networks. You can use it to keep track of the latest ICM messenger version and its address.

### Retrieve Latest ICM Messenger Version

Let's interact with the Registry by getting the latest version of the Interchain Messaging Messenger deployed on Fuji C-Chain:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url fuji-c $TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_FUJI_C_CHAIN "latestVersion()(uint256)" 
```

The response should be something like this:

```bash
1
```
