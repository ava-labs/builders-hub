          Lists the latest transactions on one of the Primary Network chains.


          Transactions are filterable by addresses, txTypes, and timestamps.
          When querying for latest transactions without an address parameter,
          filtering by txTypes and timestamps is not supported. An address
          filter must be provided to utilize txTypes and timestamp filters.


          For P-Chain, you can fetch all L1 validators related transactions like
          ConvertSubnetToL1Tx, IncreaseL1ValidatorBalanceTx etc. using the
          unique L1 validation ID. These transactions are further filterable by
          txTypes and timestamps as well.


          Given that each transaction may return a large number of UTXO objects,
          bounded only by the maximum transaction size, the query may return
          less transactions than the provided page size. The result will contain
          less results than the page size if the number of utxos contained in
          the resulting transactions reach a performance threshold.
