Previously, we explored the ERC-20 interface, a contract standard which allowed for the implementation of fungible tokens. However, there is one important use case that the ERC-20 standard cannot support: **non-fungible assets**.

## What is Fungibility?

To understand why we need ERC-721, let's first understand fungibility:

- **Fungible tokens** (ERC-20): Each token is identical and interchangeable. 1 USDC is always equal to 1 USDC.
- **Non-fungible tokens** (ERC-721): Each token is unique and has its own distinct value. One piece of digital art is not equal to another.

## Why ERC-721?

Imagine you wanted to represent an art collection within a smart contract. The smart contract would need:

- The ability to query the "balance" (i.e. the art holdings) of a particular user
- The ability to transfer art pieces from one account to another
- The ability to get information about the art collection

The biggest difference between an ERC-20 token contract and an art collection is the **fungibility** of individual items. ERC-20 tokens are inherently fungible, while items in an art collection are not (since each piece varies in value).

To account for use cases like art collections, digital collectibles, gaming items, and more, the **ERC-721 standard** was introduced.

## The ERC-721 Interface

Formally, ERC-721 is a standard for non-fungible tokens. Below is the interface of the ERC-721 token from its original proposal:

```solidity
interface ERC721 {
    /// @dev This emits when ownership of any NFT changes by any mechanism.
    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);

    /// @dev This emits when the approved address for an NFT is changed or reaffirmed.
    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 indexed _tokenId);

    /// @dev This emits when an operator is enabled or disabled for an owner.
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);

    /// @notice Count all NFTs assigned to an owner
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Find the owner of an NFT
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);

    /// @notice Transfers the ownership of an NFT from one address to another address
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data) external payable;

    /// @notice Transfers the ownership of an NFT from one address to another address
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;

    /// @notice Transfer ownership of an NFT
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;

    /// @notice Change or reaffirm the approved address for an NFT
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;

    /// @notice Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all assets
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /// @notice Get the approved address for a single NFT
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);

    /// @notice Query if an address is an authorized operator for another address
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
}
```

## Key Differences from ERC-20

### Token Identification

**ERC-20:**
```solidity
mapping(address => uint) balances;
```

**ERC-721:**
```solidity
mapping(address => uint) balances;      // Number of NFTs owned by each address
mapping(uint => address) holders;        // Owner of each specific token ID
```

The key difference is the addition of the `holders` mapping, which tracks which address owns each individual token by its unique ID. This allows each token to be distinct and non-fungible.

### Transfer Functions

ERC-721 introduces `safeTransferFrom`, which includes a safety check to ensure the receiving address can handle NFTs. This prevents tokens from being permanently lost if sent to a contract that doesn't support them.

### Approval Mechanism

Like ERC-20, ERC-721 supports approvals, but with two levels:
- **Single token approval**: Approve someone to transfer a specific NFT
- **Operator approval**: Approve someone to manage all your NFTs

## Common Use Cases

ERC-721 tokens are used for:

- **Digital Art**: Unique artwork pieces with verifiable ownership
- **Collectibles**: Trading cards, virtual items, and memorabilia
- **Gaming Assets**: In-game items, characters, and land
- **Real Estate**: Tokenized property ownership
- **Identity**: Unique credentials and certificates
- **Domain Names**: Blockchain-based domain systems

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the ERC-721 standard, you're ready to create your own NFT collection. In the next section, we'll prepare the files needed for your NFTs, including images and metadata.
