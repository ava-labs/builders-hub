## What Makes an Agent Autonomous?

In the previous lesson, you still had to sign each payment manually. A truly **autonomous agent** operates without any user interaction per transaction:

- **No wallet popups** for each payment
- **Pre-authorized budget** limits spending
- **Independent operation** - the agent decides when to pay

This is achieved by giving the agent its own wallet with a limited budget.

## Agent Wallet Architecture

The autonomous agent system creates a **dedicated wallet** separate from your main wallet:

```
Your Main Wallet                 Agent Wallet
┌─────────────────┐             ┌─────────────────┐
│ Your funds      │  Fund →     │ Limited budget  │
│ You control     │             │ Agent controls  │
│ Signs manually  │             │ Signs auto      │
└─────────────────┘  ← Withdraw └─────────────────┘
```

### Security Model

1. **Isolated funds**: Agent can only spend what you transfer to it
2. **Encrypted storage**: Private key is encrypted in browser localStorage
3. **Budget cap**: Default \$0.75, maximum \$5.00
4. **Withdrawal**: You can retrieve remaining funds anytime

## Step-by-Step: Creating an Autonomous Agent

### Step 1: Navigate to Autonomous Agents

1. Open the starter kit at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click the **"AI Agent"** tab
3. Select **"Autonomous-Agents"** from the sub-navigation

### Step 2: Connect Your Main Wallet

1. Click **"Connect Wallet"**
2. Ensure you're on **Avalanche Fuji Testnet**
3. Your wallet address appears in the header

### Step 3: Create Agent Wallet

1. In the **Authorization Panel**, click **"Create Agent Wallet"**
2. A new wallet address is generated
3. The private key is encrypted and stored in your browser

The agent wallet starts with zero balance - it cannot spend anything yet.

### Step 4: Fund the Agent

1. Enter a budget amount (e.g., $0.75 USDC)
2. Click **"Fund Agent"**
3. Sign the transaction in your main wallet
4. USDC transfers from your wallet to the agent wallet

The agent is now authorized to spend up to your funded amount.

### Step 5: Query Cryptocurrency Prices

With the agent funded, you can now use it autonomously:

1. Type a command like **"price of ETH"** or **"market summary"**
2. Click **Send** - no wallet popup appears
3. The agent signs the payment automatically using its private key
4. Price data is fetched and displayed

Each query costs **\$0.02 USDC** for the cryptocurrency price lookup service.

### Step 6: Observe Autonomous Payments

Watch the **Service Network** panel:

- Each successful call shows the service used
- Payment amount (\$0.02) is displayed
- Agent's remaining balance updates automatically

The agent made payments without any manual confirmation from you.

### Step 7: Withdraw Remaining Funds

When you're done:

1. Click **"Withdraw"** in the Authorization Panel
2. Enter the amount to withdraw (or click "Max")
3. The agent signs a transfer back to your main wallet
4. Your main wallet receives the remaining USDC

## Smart Commands

The agent understands various commands:

| Command | Action | Cost |
|---------|--------|------|
| "price of ETH" | Single crypto price | \$0.02 |
| "price of BTC, AVAX" | Multiple prices | \$0.02 each |
| "market summary" | Top 3 cryptos | \$0.06 total |
| "top coins" | Top 5 cryptos | \$0.10 total |

The agent parses your request and makes the appropriate number of paid API calls.

## Security Considerations

### Browser Storage

The agent's private key is stored in browser localStorage:

- **Encrypted** using your wallet address as the encryption key
- **Session-bound** - clearing browser data removes the wallet
- **Single device** - the agent only exists on the browser where created

### Best Practices

1. **Fund conservatively**: Only transfer what you plan to use
2. **Withdraw when done**: Don't leave large balances in agent wallets
3. **Use testnet first**: Always test on Fuji before mainnet
4. **Clear data carefully**: Clearing browser storage deletes the agent wallet

### What the Agent Cannot Do

- Access your main wallet's private key
- Spend more than its funded balance
- Operate on a different device/browser

## Real-World Applications

This autonomous agent pattern enables:

- **AI assistants** that pay for premium data sources
- **Trading bots** that pay for real-time market data
- **Research agents** that access paid APIs independently
- **Automation workflows** that operate without human supervision

The x402 protocol makes these autonomous payments possible with blockchain security and transparency.
