Avalanche L1s are fully customizable blockchains that can be tailored to meet specific needs. They are built on the Avalanche consensus protocol and can be used for a variety of applications, including DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and enterprise solutions.

## Independence and Scalability

Custom blockchains and their associated Avalanche L1s operate independently:

- They specify their own execution logic.
- They determine their own fee structures.
- They maintain their own state.
- They facilitate their own networking.
- They provide their own security.

This independence ensures that custom blockchains don't share execution threads, storage, or networking with other custom blockchain networks or the Primary Network. As a result, the Avalanche network can:

- Scale up easily
- Enable lower latency
- Achieve higher transactions per second (TPS)
- Offer lower transaction costs

By leveraging custom blockchains and custom blockchain networks, Avalanche creates a flexible and scalable ecosystem that can adapt to a wide range of use cases and requirements.
