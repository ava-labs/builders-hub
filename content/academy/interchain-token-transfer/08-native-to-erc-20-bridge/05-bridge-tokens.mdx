### Transfer the L1's Native Token to the C-Chain

Now that all the bridge contracts have been deployed and configured, you can transfer native tokens from your C-Chain to Echo using our toolbox:

<Callout>
Make sure you have:
1. Successfully registered your remote bridge
2. Have enough native tokens in your C-Chain wallet for the transfer
3. Have enough test AVAX for gas fees
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <TestSend />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

### Verify the Transfer

After initiating the transfer, you can verify it was successful by:

1. Checking the transaction status in the toolbox
2. Checking the transaction status in Core Wallet
3. Viewing the transaction details on the [Fuji Explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io)
4. Checking your token balance in Core Wallet on the destination chain

The transfer process may take a few moments to complete as it involves cross-chain communication. You can track the progress through the transaction hash.
