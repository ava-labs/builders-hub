Next, we need to transfer the AVAX you've just claimed from the Faucet on the C-Chain to the
P-Chain. You will need AVAX on the P-Chain to pay for transactions creating your L1.

Click on the arrow icon to transfer balance from C-Chain to P-Chain, or click "Get tokens" to airdrop 2 AVAX to your P-Chain wallet.
