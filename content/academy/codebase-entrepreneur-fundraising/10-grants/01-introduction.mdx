The Avalanche Foundation offers various funding opportunities for builders in the Web3 space. Unlike venture capital investments that prioritize monetary returns, foundation grants focus on creating ecosystem impact and supporting projects committed to the long-term growth of Avalanche.

These grants are ideal for projects that fill ecosystem gaps, create public goods, or add significant value to the Avalanche community. Before applying, it's important to understand how grants differ from other foundation offerings:

- **Foundation Grants**: Support ecosystem impact vs. monetary returns
- **Blizzard**: VC-style funding for revenue-generating projects
- **Hackathons**: Very early-stage ideas and MVPs
- **Codebase**: Accelerator with mentorship, focused on moving from MVP to product

The [grant programs](https://build.avax.network/grants) themselves (infrastructure, AI, retro) are designed to fill specific ecosystem gaps, operate on a milestone-based structure, and remain open year-round for applications.
