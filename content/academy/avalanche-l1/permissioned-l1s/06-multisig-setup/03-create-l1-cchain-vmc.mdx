import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';
import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/toolbox/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx";
import CreateChain from "@/components/toolbox/console/layer-1/create/CreateChain";
import ConvertToL1 from "@/components/toolbox/console/layer-1/create/ConvertToL1";
import DeployValidatorManager from "@/components/toolbox/console/permissioned-l1s/validator-manager-setup/DeployValidatorManager.tsx";
import Initialize from "@/components/toolbox/console/permissioned-l1s/validator-manager-setup/Initialize.tsx";
import InitValidatorSet from "@/components/toolbox/console/permissioned-l1s/validator-manager-setup/InitValidatorSet.tsx";

For the multi-sig setup, we'll deploy the Validator Manager Contract on the **C-Chain** instead of on the L1 itself. This provides better tooling support and allows validator management to remain operational independently of your L1.

<Callout type="warning">
This section assumes you've completed the earlier chapters and understand the VMC deployment process. If not, please review the [Create an L1](/academy/permissioned-l1s/03-create-an-L1/01-create-subnet) and [Validator Manager Deployment](/academy/permissioned-l1s/04-validator-manager-deployment/01-vmc-deployment-intro) sections first.

## Key Difference: C-Chain Deployment

When deploying the VMC on C-Chain instead of your L1:

| Aspect | VMC on L1 | VMC on C-Chain |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Genesis Proxy** | Pre-deployed at `0xfacade...` | Not applicable |
| **Contract Deployment** | Upgrade existing proxy | Fresh deployment |
| **VMC Address** | Fixed (`0xfacade...`) | Dynamic (deployment address) |
| **Conversion Parameter** | Points to L1 blockchain ID | Points to C-Chain blockchain ID |

## Setup Process

<Steps>
<Step>

### Create Subnet and Chain

First, create your Subnet and blockchain as you did in the previous chapters. This step remains the same - we're creating the L1 infrastructure.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
    <CreateChain embedded={true} />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>
<Step>

### Set Up Validator Node

Launch a validator node for your L1. Use the managed testnet infrastructure or your own Docker setup.

You can create a managed node at the [Testnet Infrastructure Console](/console/testnet-infra/nodes).

<Callout type="info">
The node setup is the same regardless of where the VMC is deployed. The difference is only in the contract architecture.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

### Deploy Validator Manager on C-Chain

Now, instead of upgrading the pre-deployed proxy on your L1, we'll deploy the Validator Manager directly on the C-Chain.

**Make sure you have your wallet connected to the C-Chain (Fuji Testnet)** before deploying.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
    <DeployValidatorManager />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

**Important**: Save the deployed contract address - you'll need it for the conversion step.

</Step>
<Step>

### Convert Subnet to L1

When converting, the key difference is specifying the **C-Chain blockchain ID** and your **newly deployed VMC address**:

- **Validator Manager Blockchain ID**: Set to C-Chain's blockchain ID (not your L1's)
- **Validator Manager Address**: The address from Step 3 (not `0xfacade...`)

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
    <ConvertToL1 />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>
<Step>

### Initialize Validator Manager

Initialize the VMC on C-Chain with your L1's configuration. Make sure you're connected to C-Chain.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
    <Initialize />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>
<Step>

### Initialize Validator Set

Complete the setup by initializing the validator set:

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
    <InitValidatorSet />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Verification

After completing these steps, you should have:

1. ✅ A new L1 blockchain running with your validator(s)
2. ✅ A Validator Manager Contract deployed on the C-Chain
3. ✅ The VMC initialized with your L1's subnet ID
4. ✅ The initial validator set registered

You're now ready to set up the multi-sig governance layer in the following sections.

## Next Steps

In the next section, you'll learn how to create a Safe/Ash wallet that will serve as the multi-sig controller for your PoA Manager.
