## Introduction

Avalanche Granite is the latest upgrade to the Avalanche network. It includes major improvements including P-Chain epoched views for ICM, secp256r1 support for biometric authentication, and dynamic minimum block times for faster transactions.

## Prerequisites

- An existing AvalancheGo node running any version prior to v1.14.0
- Basic command line knowledge
- Access to your node's terminal or SSH

## Backup Your Node First

Before upgrading your node, it's crucial to backup your staker files which identify your node on the network. These files are essential for recovering your node if anything goes wrong.

Run the following commands to backup your staker files:

```bash
cd
cp ~/.avalanchego/staking/staker.crt .
cp ~/.avalanchego/staking/staker.key .
```

Download these `staker.crt` and `staker.key` files and store them in a secure, private location. These files can be used to fully recreate your node if needed.

<Callout type="warning">
If you use your node for development purposes and have keystore users on your node, make sure to back those up as well.
</Callout>

## Primary Network Nodes

Choose one of the following methods to upgrade your Primary Network node to Granite:

### Method 1: Using the Installer Script (Recommended)

The easiest way to upgrade is using the AvalancheGo installer script.

<Steps>
<Step>

#### Get the Installer Script

If you don't already have the installer script, download it:

```bash
wget -nd -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-docs/master/scripts/avalanchego-installer.sh
chmod 755 avalanchego-installer.sh
```

</Step>
<Step>

#### Run the Installer

Execute the installer script:

```bash
./avalanchego-installer.sh
```

The script will automatically detect your existing installation and switch to upgrade mode:

```bash
AvalancheGo installer
---------------------
Preparing environment...
Found amd64 architecture...
Looking for amd64 version latest...
Node version found.
Attempting to download: 
   https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/download/v1.14.0/avalanchego-linux-amd64-v1.14.0.tar.gz
```

</Step>
<Step>

#### Automatic Upgrade

The script will:
1. Stop your current node
2. Download and install AvalancheGo v1.14.0 (Granite)
3. Restart your node with the new version

You'll see output similar to:

```bash
Node upgraded, starting service...
New node version:
avalanche/1.14.0 [network=mainnet, database=v1.4.0, commit=...]
Done!
```

</Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Docker

For Docker users, pull the new Granite image:

- **Docker Image**: [`avaplatform/avalanchego:v1.14.0`](https://hub.docker.com/r/avaplatform/avalanchego/tags?name=v1.14.0)

```bash
docker pull avaplatform/avalanchego:v1.14.0
```

### Method 3: Pre-Built Binary

1. Go to the [AvalancheGo releases page](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases)
2. Find version v1.14.0 (Granite release)
3. Download the appropriate file for your system:
   - **Linux (AMD64)**: `avalanchego-linux-amd64-v1.14.0.tar.gz`
   - **Linux (ARM64)**: `avalanchego-linux-arm64-v1.14.0.tar.gz`

4. Extract and run:

```bash
tar -xvf avalanchego-linux-amd64-v1.14.0.tar.gz
./avalanchego-v1.14.0-linux/avalanchego
```

### Method 4: Build from Source

For developers who want to build from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository (skip if already cloned)
git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego.git
cd avalanchego

# Fetch and checkout Granite release
git fetch --all --tags
git checkout --force tags/v1.14.0

# Build the binary
./scripts/build.sh

# Verify the version
./build/avalanchego --version

# Run the node
./build/avalanchego
```

## L1s/Subnets Nodes

For nodes running L1s (formerly Subnets), you need to upgrade both AvalancheGo and the Subnet-EVM plugin:

### Method 1: Docker (Easiest)

Use the Docker image that includes both AvalancheGo v1.14.0 and Subnet-EVM v0.8.0:

- **Docker Image**: [`avaplatform/subnet-evm_avalanchego:v0.8.0_v1.14.0`](https://hub.docker.com/r/avaplatform/subnet-evm_avalanchego/tags?name=v0.8.0_v1.14.0)

```bash
docker pull avaplatform/subnet-evm_avalanchego:v0.8.0_v1.14.0
```

<Callout type="info">
This Docker image includes the Subnet-EVM v0.8.0 binary pre-installed, so no additional plugin installation is needed.
</Callout>

### Method 2: Manual Binary Update

If running AvalancheGo manually, you need to:

1. **Upgrade AvalancheGo** using any method from the Primary Network section above
2. **Update the Subnet-EVM plugin**:

```bash
# Stop your node first
sudo systemctl stop avalanchego

# Download the plugin (example for Linux AMD64)
wget https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases/download/v0.8.0/subnet-evm_0.8.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf subnet-evm_0.8.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz

# Copy to plugins folder and rename to your VM ID
cp subnet-evm ~/.avalanchego/plugins/<YOUR_VM_ID>

# Restart your node
sudo systemctl start avalanchego
```

<Callout type="warning">
Ensure the plugin binary has the correct permissions and is renamed to match your L1's VM ID in the plugins directory.
</Callout>

## Verifying the Upgrade

After upgrading, verify you're running Granite by checking the node version.

### API Health Check

Run this curl command on your node machine to get detailed version information. You can also use the [API Health Check](/docs/api-reference/health-api#healthhealth) to check the node version.

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.getNodeVersion"
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

You should see a response similar to:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"version":"avalanchego/1.14.0","databaseVersion":"v1.4.5","rpcProtocolVersion":"44","gitCommit":"dce38e90b1542fafa3c2b8efa8ef864d7a370eb6","vmVersions":{"avm":"v1.14.0","evm":"v0.15.4","platform":"v1.14.0"}},"id":1}
```

The `version` field should show `avalanche/1.14.0` confirming your node is running Granite.

## Stay Updated

To receive notifications about future upgrades:

1. **Avalanche Notify**: If you have a node, subscribe to the [Avalanche Notify service](/docs/nodes/maintain/enroll-in-avalanche-notify) with your node ID
2. **GitHub Notifications**: Watch the [AvalancheGo repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego) and select "Releases" under custom notifications
3. **For L1s/Subnets**: Also watch the [Subnet-EVM repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm) for plugin updates

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the upgrade:

- Ensure you've properly backed up your staker files
- Check that your previous node version is completely stopped before upgrading
- For service-based installations, verify the service name (could be `avalanchego.service` or `avalanche.service`)
- For L1s/Subnets, ensure the Subnet-EVM plugin is updated to v0.8.0 and renamed to match your VM ID
- Join the [Avalanche Discord](https://discord.gg/avax) for community support
