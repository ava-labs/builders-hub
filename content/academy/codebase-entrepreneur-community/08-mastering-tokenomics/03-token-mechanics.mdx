Effective tokenomics includes mechanisms for bootstrapping and user acquisition that vary based on your business model:

For B2C protocols (like DeFi applications):
- Reward liquidity providers who contribute digital assets to your Total Value Locked (TVL)
- Create incentives for individual users to participate in the ecosystem

For launchpads:
- Implement reputation mechanisms to reward supporters
- Allocate ownership based on higher reputation levels

For B2B engagements (such as Layer 1/Layer 2 platforms):
- Target applications building on your platform rather than individual users
- Develop contract-based rewards tied to specific milestones (acquiring X protocols, attracting X users)
- Focus less on airdrops and more on business agreements with token incentives

Your distribution strategy should align with your business model, whether you're building a protocol for direct interaction or creating a foundation for others to build upon.
