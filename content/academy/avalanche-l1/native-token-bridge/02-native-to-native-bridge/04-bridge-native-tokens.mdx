# Bridge Native Tokens as Gas Tokens

With your Native-to-Native bridge fully configured and collateralized, you can now transfer native tokens that become **native gas tokens** on the destination chain.

## Transfer Flow

Here's what happens when you bridge tokens via NativeTokenRemote:

```
Source Chain                               Destination Chain
┌─────────────────────────────┐           ┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │           │                             │
│  1. User sends AVAX         │           │                             │
│         ↓                   │           │                             │
│  2. AVAX → WAVAX (auto)     │           │                             │
│         ↓                   │    ICM    │                             │
│  3. WAVAX locked in         │──────────▶│  4. NativeTokenRemote       │
│     NativeTokenHome         │           │     receives message        │
│                             │           │         ↓                   │
│                             │           │  5. Calls Native Minter     │
│                             │           │         ↓                   │
│                             │           │  6. Native tokens minted    │
│                             │           │     to user's address       │
└─────────────────────────────┘           └─────────────────────────────┘
```

## The Key Difference

When tokens arrive on the destination:

| ERC-20 Remote | Native Remote |
|---------------|---------------|
| Mints ERC-20 tokens | Mints **native tokens** |
| Can't use for gas directly | **Can use for gas fees** |
| Needs swap for gas | Ready to use immediately |

## Bridging Steps

<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect to Source Chain

Switch your wallet to the source chain (e.g., Fuji C-Chain) where your native tokens originate.

</Step>

<Step>
### Initiate Transfer

Use the transfer tool to send tokens to the destination chain:

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Bridge fully collateralized (from previous step)
2. Native tokens to bridge
3. Additional tokens for gas fees
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <TestSend />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Wait for Cross-Chain Confirmation

After submitting:

1. **Source transaction confirms**: Tokens locked in NativeTokenHome
2. **ICM relay**: Message sent to destination
3. **Destination minting**: NativeTokenRemote calls Native Minter
4. **Tokens appear**: Native tokens in your destination wallet

</Step>

<Step>
### Verify on Destination

Switch to the destination chain and check:

1. Your **native balance** (used for gas)
2. The amount should match what you bridged
3. You can immediately use these tokens for transactions

</Step>
</Steps>

## Using Bridged Native Tokens

The key advantage of native-to-native bridging is that bridged tokens are **immediately usable for gas**:

```javascript
// On destination chain, your balance increases
// No swaps or wrapping needed

// You can immediately send transactions
await wallet.sendTransaction({
  to: "0x...",
  value: bridgedAmount,
  // Gas is paid with your bridged native tokens!
});
```

## Bridging Back

To return native tokens to the source chain:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect to Destination Chain

Switch to the chain where you have bridged native tokens.

</Step>

<Step>
### Send Back to Source

Use the same transfer tool, but:
- Select the **source chain** as destination
- Enter the amount to bridge back

When bridging back:
1. Native tokens are **burned** on destination
2. Wrapped tokens are **unlocked** on source
3. You can unwrap to get original native tokens

</Step>
</Steps>

## Collateral Dynamics

As users bridge tokens:

### When Bridging OUT (Source → Destination)

```
Collateral Locked: +X
Minted Supply: +X
Available to Mint: -X
```

### When Bridging BACK (Destination → Source)

```
Collateral Released: +X
Burned Supply: +X
Available to Mint: +X
```

## Burned Fees Reporting

When bridged native tokens are used for gas and burned:

1. The burned amount is tracked
2. Anyone can call `reportBurnedTxFees()` to report to home
3. The reporter receives a reward (if configured)
4. The home contract updates its accounting

This keeps the bridge accounting accurate over time.

## Comparing Bridge Types

| Feature | Native → ERC-20 | Native → Native |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Destination token** | ERC-20 | Native (gas) |
| **Use for gas** | ❌ Need swap | ✅ Direct |
| **Collateral required** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Native Minter needed** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Setup complexity** | Lower | Higher |

## Summary

You've now mastered Native-to-Native bridging:

1. ✅ Deployed NativeTokenRemote on a chain with Native Minter
2. ✅ Registered the remote with the home contract
3. ✅ Added collateral to enable minting
4. ✅ Bridged tokens that became native gas tokens
