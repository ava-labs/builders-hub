In this section, we will deploy and interact with a basic smart contract on the Avalanche Fuji Testnet.
We will compile the contract, deploy it to the blockchain, and verify that it is successfully live on-chain.
Through this hands-on exercise, we will gain practical experience in how smart contracts run and how they store data on Avalanche.

### Objectives
- Write and compile a Solidity smart contract.  
- Deploy it on Avalanche Fuji using Remix and MetaMask.  
- Verify the deployed contract on SnowTrace.  
- If you succeed, you will earn an NFT certificate.

<Steps>
<Step>

### 1. Add Avalanche Fuji Testnet

You can easily add the **Avalanche Fuji Testnet** to MetaMask.  
Just click the **fox icon** at the bottom left of  
<a href="https://testnet.snowtrace.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Snowtrace Testnet
</a>, and it will be added with a single click.

</Step>
<Step>

### Get Test Funds

To deploy and interact, you need test AVAX on Fuji.  
[Get Test Funds](https://build.avax.network/docs/dapps/smart-contract-dev/get-test-funds)
If you’re new to Remix, check out [this guide](https://build.avax.network/docs/dapps/smart-contract-dev/deploy-with-remix-ide).

</Step>
<Step>

### Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org). 

Create a new Solidity file (e.g., LittleRobot.sol) and paste:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract LittleRobot {
    string public message = "Hello! I am a little robot now living on the Avalanche blockchain!";
}
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Compile with Solidity ^0.8.20. 

^0.8.20 means any compiler version greater than or equal to 0.8.20, but lower than 0.9.0.
In other words, your contract will compile with 0.8.20, 0.8.21, 0.8.22, … but not with 0.9.0 or higher.

</Step>
<Step>

### Connect your wallet and deploy the contract.  

Once deployed, a unique contract address will be generated on the blockchain — like a birth certificate proving your little robot has come to life.

</Step>
<Step>

### Check on SnowTrace

Open [SnowTrace Fuji Explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/), paste your **contract address**, and check `message()` under **Read Contract** to see your robot’s greeting.

</Step>
<Step>

### What does this contract do?

By deploying this simple contract, a little robot comes to life on the Avalanche Fuji testnet chain. When you call the `message()` function, the robot introduces itself with a friendly greeting.

</Step>
<Step>

### Submit Your Contract

Great job deploying your first contract.

Next, copy your **contract address** from Remix.

Use the form below to submit your contract address:  

[Submit Contract Address](https://example.com/submit)

If the address is valid, you will receive an NFT certificate (coming soon ).
