## Overview

Parallel Markets offers a suite of streamlined identity verification and compliance solutions designed for financial institutions and blockchain platforms. Their innovative KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) tools verify user identities without the traditional friction in onboarding processes. For blockchain applications implementing txAllowlist precompiles, Parallel Markets provides a portable identity solution that enables users to verify once and access multiple platforms, creating a seamless experience while maintaining robust compliance.

## Features

- **Portable Identity Verification**: Users can complete KYC verification once and reuse their verified credentials across platforms in the Parallel Markets ecosystem.
- **Comprehensive KYC/AML Screening**: Automated verification against global sanctions lists, PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) databases, and adverse media sources.
- **Business Verification (KYB)**: Verify corporate entities, map beneficial ownership structures, and perform due diligence checks for institutional users.
- **No-Code Integration**: Implement identity verification with minimal development resources through their JavaScript SDK or API integration.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of user profiles for changes in risk status or sanctions exposure.
- **Customizable Verification Flows**: Design verification journeys specific to your platform's risk profile and regulatory requirements.
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Access verification results and monitor compliance metrics through a unified dashboard.

## Getting Started

To integrate Parallel Markets into your Avalanche-based application with txAllowlist precompiles, follow these steps:

1. **Account Setup**: Contact Parallel Markets to create an account and obtain API credentials.
2. **Integration Planning**: Choose between JavaScript SDK for frontend integration or direct API calls from your backend.
3. **Configure Verification Flow**: Set up your verification requirements based on your compliance needs.
4. **Implementation**: Follow the [documentation](https://developer.parallelmarkets.com/) to add the verification flow to your application.
5. **Testing**: Verify the integration in a sandbox environment before going live.
6. **Verification-to-Allowlist Mapping**: Connect user verification status to your txAllowlist management to ensure only verified users can transact.

## Integration with txAllowlist

Parallel Markets is particularly well-suited for platforms implementing txAllowlist precompiles because:

1. **Streamlined Allowlisting**: When a user completes verification through Parallel Markets, your application can automatically add their wallet address to the txAllowlist.
2. **Verification Status Monitoring**: If a user's compliance status changes (e.g., they appear on a sanctions list), your application can receive webhook notifications and remove their address from the allowlist.
3. **Programmatic Control**: The API-driven approach allows for complete automation of the allowlist management based on identity verification results.
4. **Reduced Onboarding Friction**: Users who have already verified with another platform in the Parallel Markets ecosystem can be fast-tracked through your verification process.
