## Overview

Jumio is a leading identity verification and KYC/AML compliance platform powered by AI and machine learning. Their comprehensive suite of solutions enables blockchain applications to verify user identities securely and efficiently, making them an excellent partner for projects implementing txAllowlist precompiles. Jumio's technology combines ID verification, biometric authentication, and AML screening to ensure that only legitimate users can access restricted blockchain applications, while providing a streamlined verification process that minimizes friction.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Identity Verification**: Verifies government-issued IDs with advanced OCR and authenticity checks across 5,000+ ID types from 200+ countries and territories.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Ensures the person is physically present and matches their ID through advanced liveness detection and facial recognition.
- **Deepfake Detection**: Employs sophisticated algorithms to detect and prevent synthetic identity fraud attempts.
- **AML Screening**: Automatically screens users against global watchlists for sanctions, politically exposed persons (PEPs), and adverse media.
- **Risk Signals**: Provides additional verification through address checks, phone verification, email validation, and government database checks.
- **Customizable Risk Scoring**: Determine verification requirements based on transaction risk levels with configurable workflows.
- **Self-Service Rules Editor**: Adjust verification rules in real-time to respond to emerging fraud patterns.
- **Omnichannel Support**: Verify users across web, mobile, and API integrations with consistent security standards.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing screening of user profiles against watchlists to maintain compliance.

## Getting Started
