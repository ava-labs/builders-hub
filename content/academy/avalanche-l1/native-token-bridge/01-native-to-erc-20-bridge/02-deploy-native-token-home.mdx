# Deploy NativeTokenHome

The `NativeTokenHome` contract is deployed on the source chain (where your native token originates). It serves as the home base for your bridge, locking wrapped native tokens when users bridge out.

## Understanding NativeTokenHome

The NativeTokenHome contract:

- **References your wrapped native token** (e.g., WAVAX on Fuji)
- **Locks tokens** when users bridge to remote chains
- **Releases tokens** when users bridge back from remote chains
- **Manages remote contract registrations** for security
- **Communicates via ICM** (Interchain Messaging)

## Deployment Parameters

When deploying NativeTokenHome, you'll provide:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Teleporter Registry** | The ICM registry contract on this chain |
| **Teleporter Manager** | Address that can manage ICM settings (usually your address) |
| **Min Teleporter Version** | Minimum ICM version required (usually `1`) |
| **Wrapped Token Address** | Your wrapped native token contract (e.g., WAVAX) |

<Step>
### Connect to Source Chain

Ensure your wallet is connected to the **Fuji C-Chain** (or your source chain). The toolbox will automatically detect the chain and show relevant options.

<Callout type="info">
For Fuji C-Chain, the wrapped native token (**WAVAX**) is already deployed. The toolbox will detect it automatically.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy NativeTokenHome

Use the Deploy Token Home tool below. Make sure to:

1. Select **"Native Token"** as the Transferrer Type
2. Verify the **Wrapped Token Address** is populated (WAVAX on Fuji)
3. Confirm the **Teleporter Registry** address is set

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Connected your Core Wallet to the Fuji testnet
2. Sufficient test AVAX for gas fees
3. Selected "Native Token" as the transferrer type
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <DeployTokenHome />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Save the Contract Address

After deployment, the **Token Home Address** will be displayed. Save this address—you'll need it when deploying the remote contract.

<Callout title="Important" type="info">
The Token Home address is required for:
- Deploying ERC20TokenRemote or NativeTokenRemote
- Verifying bridge configuration
- Troubleshooting transfer issues
</Callout>

</Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens During Deployment

When you deploy NativeTokenHome:

1. **Contract creation**: A new NativeTokenHome contract is deployed
2. **Configuration stored**: The wrapped token address, registry, and manager are set
3. **Ready for remotes**: The contract can now accept registrations from remote contracts

## Contract State After Deployment

After deployment, your NativeTokenHome:

- ✅ Is linked to your wrapped native token
- ✅ Is connected to the Teleporter Registry for ICM
- ✅ Is ready to accept remote contract registrations
- ❌ Has no remote contracts registered yet (we'll do this next)

## Next Steps

Now that you have a NativeTokenHome deployed, you need to:

1. **Deploy ERC20TokenRemote** on the destination chain (Echo)
2. **Register the remote** to establish the bridge connection
