Authentic engagement is the foundation of strong Web3 communities. Build a grassroots community without early dependence on key opinion leaders (KOLs). Create systems where community members can provide product feedback that actually gets implemented, showing they're valued contributors.

As your project grows, consider formal ambassador programs to scale your community reach into regions and demographics you couldn't otherwise access.
