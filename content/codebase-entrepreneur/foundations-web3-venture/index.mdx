## Level 1: Foundations of a Web3 Venture (Module 1 - 3)

These three modules are designed to give you a strong foundation for building and scaling your startup with confidence. You’ll begin by setting up your company on solid ground, mastering the essential legal, financial, compliance, and security principles that safeguard your business. From there, you’ll learn to shape and refine your vision through the Business Model Canvas, ensuring your strategy is both sustainable and customer-focused. Finally, you’ll dive deep into understanding the people who matter most—your stakeholders and users—by identifying their needs, creating personas, and translating insights into impactful solutions. Together, these modules equip you with the practical tools to launch, grow, and sustain a successful venture.
