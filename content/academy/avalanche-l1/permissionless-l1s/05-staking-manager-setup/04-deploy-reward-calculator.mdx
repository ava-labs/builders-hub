The **Reward Calculator** determines how staking rewards are distributed based on validator uptime and delegation amounts.

## What is the Reward Calculator?

The `ExampleRewardCalculator` is a reference implementation that:
- Calculates rewards based on validator uptime percentage (80% threshold)
- Uses a linear, non-compounding reward formula
- Implements the `IRewardCalculator` interface

## Customization for Network Control

This is an **example implementation** that can be modified to control your network's economics:
- **Adjust reward rates** to incentivize or limit new permissionless validators
- **Balance power dynamics** between original PoA validators and new entrants
- **Implement custom logic** like tiered rewards, bonuses, or penalties based on your network's needs

The reward calculator gives you fine-grained control over how attractive it is for new validators to join versus maintaining the influence of your initial validator set.

## Deploy the Contract

When deploying, you'll specify the **Reward Rate** in basis points, where 100 basis points equals 1% annual percentage rate (APR). For example, entering 500 would set a 5% APR for staking rewards.
