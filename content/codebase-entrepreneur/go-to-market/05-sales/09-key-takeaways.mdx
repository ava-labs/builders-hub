1. **Define your core value:** Focus on the emotional benefit, not technical features. You're selling outcomes, not technology.

2. **Know your audience:** Map all stakeholders in the buying process and understand their distinct motivations.

3. **Partner with early customers:** Treat first implementations as collaborative partnerships with clear success metrics.

4. **Structure your approach:** Separate awareness and conversion content; follow a consistent sales call format.

5. **Systematize follow-ups:** Implement a CRM from day one to ensure consistent outreach.

6. **Hire strategically:** Understand your own sales process before bringing on dedicated sales staff with industry connections.
