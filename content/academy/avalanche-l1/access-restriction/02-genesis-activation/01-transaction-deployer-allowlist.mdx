## Overview

The **Transaction AllowList** precompile controls **who can submit transactions** to your Avalanche L1. If a wallet address is not allowed, transactions from that address will fail before they can be executed.

- **Precompile address**: `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000002`
- **Genesis config key**: `txAllowListConfig`
- **Permission model**: uses the [AllowList interface](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/allowlist-interface)

This is commonly used to:

- Build **permissioned networks**
- Enforce **KYC/AML** policies
- Reduce spam during early-stage deployments

## Genesis activation

To enable it from genesis, include a config block like - the Console will have a toggle button to do this automatically:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "txAllowListConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x...yourAdminAddress"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `adminAddresses` become **AllowList Admins** for this precompile (can manage Admin/Manager/Enabled roles).
