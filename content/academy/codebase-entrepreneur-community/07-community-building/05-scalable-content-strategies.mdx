  <p>"I think the best formats for founders are about sharing their experience and their point of views. And this is extremely scalable because you should have a lot of those views and opinions. As a founder, there's a reason that you are creating this thing. And it should be easy for you to think about why you're making that thing and to share it regularly."</p>

The most sustainable content formats for founders revolve around sharing personal experiences and viewpoints. Don't worry about repeating key messages - only about 13% of your followers see each post. Share real work experiences like hiring decisions, team building stories, and insights into your building process. This builds trust through authentic sharing.

Document your journey and update your community regularly. The more you can bring people along for the ride, the more invested they'll become in your success.
