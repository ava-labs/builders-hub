# ERC-20 to Native Token Bridge

In this section, you'll learn how to bridge an **ERC-20 token** (like USDC) from Fuji C-Chain to your own L1, where it becomes the **native gas token**.

## Use Case

This bridge type is ideal when:

- You want to use an **established stablecoin** (like USDC) as your chain's gas currency
- You need **predictable gas costs** for users (no volatile native token)
- You're building for **enterprise or regulated environments** that prefer fiat-pegged tokens

## Architecture Overview

```
Source Chain (Fuji C-Chain)                 Destination Chain (Your L1)
┌──────────────────────────────┐           ┌──────────────────────────────┐
│                              │           │                              │
│  USDC (ERC-20)               │           │  Native Token (minted USDC)  │
│       ↓                      │           │       ↑                      │
│  ERC20TokenHome   ───────────│───────────│  NativeTokenRemote           │
│  (locks USDC)                │    ICM    │  (calls Native Minter)       │
│                              │           │                              │
└──────────────────────────────┘           └──────────────────────────────┘
```

## Contracts Involved

| Contract | Chain | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **ERC20TokenHome** | Fuji C-Chain | Locks USDC when bridging out, releases when bridging back |
| **NativeTokenRemote** | Your L1 | Calls Native Minter to create native tokens |
| **Native Minter Precompile** | Your L1 | System contract that mints native tokens |

## Key Requirement: Native Minter Precompile

Your L1 must have the **Native Minter precompile** enabled. This precompile:

- Is a built-in Avalanche L1 feature
- Allows authorized contracts to mint native tokens
- Must be configured in the chain's genesis
- Address: `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001`

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: You'll create an L1 with Native Minter enabled as the first step of this chapter.
</Callout>

## Collateral Requirement

Unlike ERC-20 bridging, native-token bridging requires **collateral**:

1. **Initial Reserve Imbalance**: Set during NativeTokenRemote deployment
2. **Collateral Deposit**: USDC deposited to back the minted native supply
3. **Full Collateralization**: Required before bridging is enabled

## Deployment Flow

Here's what we'll build:

| Step | Action | Chain |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Create L1 with Native Minter | Fuji (P-Chain) |
| 2 | Set up relayer | Local (Docker) |
| 3 | Deploy ERC20TokenHome | Fuji C-Chain |
| 4 | Deploy NativeTokenRemote | Your L1 |
| 5 | Register + Collateralize | Your L1 → Fuji |
| 6 | Bridge USDC → Native | Fuji → Your L1 |

## What You'll Achieve

By the end of this section:

- ✅ Your L1 uses **USDC as the native gas token**
- ✅ Users can bridge USDC from Fuji to get native tokens for gas
- ✅ The bridge is fully collateralized and secure

<Callout type="info">
**Token Backing**: Every native token minted on your L1 is backed 1:1 by USDC locked in the ERC20TokenHome contract on Fuji.
</Callout>

Let's get started by creating your L1!
