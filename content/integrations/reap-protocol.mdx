## Overview

Reap Protocol gives AI Agents the power to search real products, verify inventory, and purchase autonomously. Reap bridges Web2 shops with Web3 settlement so agents can operate in the real economy — safely, verifiably, and on-chain.  We support both Python and Typescript SDK's.

## Why Reap

Product Search → On-Chain Inventory: Agents can index any Web2 product with a single call.

x402 Negotiation Engine: Turns HTTP into a payment-capable negotiation loop.

Agentic Cart: Identity, stock, and settlement in a single atomic mission.

Self-Custody by Design: The agent controls its wallet; Reap handles the complexity.
