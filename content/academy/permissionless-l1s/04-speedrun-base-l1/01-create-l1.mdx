This section provides a streamlined walkthrough for creating a new L1 from scratch.  

You should already have a created L1 from the [Permissioned L1 course] with the Validator Manager Contract correctly set up that you can use to transform into a Permissionless L1.

## Step 1: Create Subnet with necessary Precompiles

When creating your subnet, you **must** enable the Native Minter and Reward Manager precompiles in your genesis configuration. These are essential for native token staking:

- **Native Minter**: Allows the staking manager to mint reward tokens
- **Reward Manager**: Automates reward distribution to validators

</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## Step 2: Add Initial Validator

<Step>

### Set Up Validator Node

Launch a node to track your Subnet. This node will become a validator for your Subnet, and later will be managed by the Validator Manager contract when we convert to L1.

Use our *free managed testnet infrastructure* - no Docker installation or AWS account required:

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="testnet-mainnet">
    <CreateManagedTestnetNode />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

**Managing Your Nodes**

After creating nodes, you can view and manage them at the [Testnet Infrastructure Console](/console/testnet-infra/nodes).

<Callout type="warning">
Managed nodes automatically shut down after 3 days. For production or extended testing, see the self-hosted option below.
</Callout>

### Production & Extended Testing Environments

For production environments or extended testing periods, you should use Docker to run your nodes.

    <AvalancheGoDocker />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

</Step>

## Step 3: Convert Subnet to L1

Once your subnet is running with a validator, convert it to a sovereign L1. This process:

- **Establishes Sovereignty**: Your blockchain becomes independent
- **Transfers Authority**: Validator management shifts from P-Chain to your Validator Manager Contract
- **Is Irreversible**: Once converted, you cannot revert to subnet status

### Key Conversion Parameters

1. **Subnet ID**: Your subnet's unique identifier
2. **Validator Manager Blockchain ID**: Where your VMC will be deployed (typically your L1)
3. **Validator Manager Address**: The proxy address (usually `0xfacade0000000000000000000000000000000000`)
4. **Initial Validators**: The validator(s) from your subnet

</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## Next Steps

Now that your L1 is created with the required precompiles, you're ready to deploy and configure your Validator Manager Contract.
