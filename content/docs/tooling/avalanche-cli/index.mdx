description: Build, deploy, and manage Avalanche L1s with the Avalanche-CLI
---

The Avalanche-CLI is a powerful command-line tool that streamlines the process of building, deploying, and managing Avalanche L1 blockchains (formerly known as Subnets).

## Key Features

- **Create & Deploy L1s**: Quickly create and deploy new Avalanche L1 blockchains to local, testnet, or mainnet environments
- **VM Management**: Deploy L1s with Subnet-EVM or custom Virtual Machines
- **Node Operations**: Run and manage validator nodes across different cloud providers
- **Cross-Chain Messaging**: Set up Teleporter for cross-chain communication
- **Transaction Management**: Handle native token transfers and P-Chain operations

## Getting Started

## Common Use Cases

### Local Development
Deploy and test your L1 locally before moving to testnet or mainnet.

### Production Deployment
Deploy L1s to Fuji testnet for testing, then to mainnet for production use.

### Validator Management
Add and remove validators, manage staking, and monitor node health.

### Cross-Chain Integration
Enable cross-chain messaging between your L1 and other chains using Teleporter.
