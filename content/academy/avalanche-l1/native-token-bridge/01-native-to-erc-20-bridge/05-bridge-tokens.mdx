# Bridge Native Tokens

With your bridge fully configured, you can now transfer native tokens from the source chain to the destination chain, where they'll appear as ERC-20 tokens.

## Transfer Flow

Here's what happens when you bridge tokens:

```
Source Chain (Fuji C-Chain)                  Destination Chain (Echo)
┌─────────────────────────────┐             ┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │             │                             │
│  1. User has AVAX           │             │                             │
│         ↓                   │             │                             │
│  2. AVAX → WAVAX (wrap)     │             │                             │
│         ↓                   │             │                             │
│  3. WAVAX locked in         │   ICM      │  4. ERC20TokenRemote        │
│     NativeTokenHome    ─────│────────────▶│     mints tokens            │
│                             │             │         ↓                   │
│                             │             │  5. User receives           │
│                             │             │     ERC-20 tokens           │
└─────────────────────────────┘             └─────────────────────────────┘

## Bridging Steps

<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect to Source Chain

Switch your wallet back to the **Fuji C-Chain**. This is where you'll initiate the transfer.

<Callout type="info">
You need AVAX (native tokens) on Fuji to bridge. The transfer tool handles wrapping automatically if needed.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Initiate Transfer

Use the transfer tool to send tokens across the bridge:

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Successfully registered your remote bridge
2. Native tokens (AVAX) in your wallet to bridge
3. Additional AVAX for gas fees
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <TestSend />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Monitor the Transfer

After initiating the transfer:

1. **Source transaction**: Your tokens are locked in NativeTokenHome
2. **ICM relay**: Message sent to destination chain
3. **Destination minting**: ERC20TokenRemote mints tokens to your address

The transfer typically takes a few seconds to complete across chains.

</Step>

<Step>
### Verify on Destination

Switch to Echo and check your balance:

1. The ERC-20 token should appear in your wallet
2. You can add the token manually using the ERC20TokenRemote address
3. The balance should match the amount you bridged

</Step>
</Steps>

## Adding the Token to Your Wallet

To see your bridged tokens in Core Wallet:

1. Open Core Wallet on the Echo network
2. Click **"Import Token"** or **"Add Custom Token"**
3. Enter the **ERC20TokenRemote address**
4. The token name and symbol will auto-populate
5. Click **"Add"**

## Bridging Back

To return tokens to the source chain:

1. Switch to the **destination chain** (Echo)
2. Use the same transfer tool
3. Select the home chain as destination
4. Enter the amount to bridge back

When bridging back:
- ERC-20 tokens are **burned** on the destination
- Wrapped tokens are **unlocked** on the source
- You can unwrap to get native tokens back

## Transfer Details

### Fees

Each transfer involves:

| Fee Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Gas (Source)** | Transaction fee to lock tokens |
| **Gas (Destination)** | Covered by relayer for minting |
| **Relayer Fee** | Optional fee for relayer operators |

### Minimum Amount

There may be minimum transfer amounts depending on:
- Gas costs
- Token decimals
- Configured minimums in the contracts

### Transfer Time

Transfer completion depends on:
- Source chain block time
- Relayer speed
- Destination chain block time

Typical time: **5-30 seconds**

## Verifying Your Bridge

You can verify the bridge is working by checking:

### On Source Chain (NativeTokenHome)
- Token balance locked in contract
- Events showing `SendToken` calls

### On Destination Chain (ERC20TokenRemote)
- Total supply of the ERC-20 token
- Events showing `Mint` calls
- Your token balance

## Summary

Congratulations! You've successfully:

1. ✅ Deployed NativeTokenHome on the source chain
2. ✅ Deployed ERC20TokenRemote on the destination chain
3. ✅ Registered the remote with the home
4. ✅ Bridged native tokens as ERC-20 tokens

## Next Steps

Now that you understand Native → ERC-20 bridging, explore:

- **Native to Native Bridge**: Bridge tokens that become native gas tokens
- **Send and Call**: Execute contract calls with your bridged tokens
- **Multi-hop Transfers**: Bridge between multiple chains
