## Open Precompile-EVM Repository in a Github Codespace

Open a Codespace on the [Precompile-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/precompile-evm/tree/avalanche-academy-start) Repository on the `avalanche-academy-start` branch by clicking the button below: 

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=avalanche-academy-start&repo=605560683&machine=standardLinux32gb)

Next a window opens and the Codespace is built. This may take a few minutes.

When the building is completed, you can access the Codespace through the browser IDE.

## Closing Codespaces

The codespace time out after 30 minutes of inactivity by default. So if you are not too worried about the 30 hour/month limit, just close the window or the tab. Alternatively, you can open the command prompt (Cmd + Shift + P) and issue the command: **Stop Current Codespace**.

## Reopen Codespaces

You can see your Codespaces on https://github.com/codespaces/. There you can stop them, reopen them and delete them.
