The Durango upgrade activates on Avalanche Mainnet on March 6, 2024 at 11 AM ET, bringing native cross-chain communication to the ecosystem. This upgrade includes seven Avalanche Community Proposals (ACPs) that enhance interoperability, developer experience, and network scalability.

**Production Release**: AvalancheGo v1.11.0
**Mainnet Activation**: March 6, 2024 at 11:00 AM ET

## Avalanche Community Proposals Included

The Durango upgrade incorporates seven ACPs:

- **ACP-23**: P-Chain Native Transfers
- **ACP-24**: Shanghai EIPs activation on C-Chain
- **ACP-25**: Virtual Machine Application Errors
- **ACP-30**: Avalanche Warp Messaging integration into EVM
- **ACP-31**: Subnet Ownership Transfer capability
- **ACP-41**: Removal of Pending Stakers
- **ACP-62**: Disabling AddValidatorTx and AddDelegatorTx

## Cross-Subnet Interoperability with Avalanche Warp Messaging

Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM) enables **native cross-chain communication to every EVM Chain in the Avalanche Ecosystem** with no third party intermediaries or trust assumptions beyond validator sets. The system uses the P-Chain as a registry for subnet validator sets with BLS public keys.

### How AWM Works

![AWM Architecture Diagram](https://images.ctfassets.net/voq4a5ue459o/4f048dc2a414c1a60bb67c7b299581b3/fe273d73529d1bbff8a3390e37f4eb7c/65bc12b118fad82932fc4693_KLrCXnfqjgHu9ltWr39vbTzOEfiYVFWu4O6GUGiVXll3XMCnAFVROeKf2q625pV0h0YSo7G2UywgsS9cocU3V6gRsoIOrdxoIC3.png?w=1600&q=80&fm=webp)

The messaging process involves untrusted relayers aggregating signatures until threshold stake requirements are met, then constructing BLS Multi-Signatures for verification.

### Key Features

- **Trust-Minimized**: No third-party intermediaries required
- **Validator-Secured**: Security derived from subnet validator sets
- **EVM-Native**: Built directly into the EVM execution layer
- **BLS Signatures**: Efficient signature aggregation for cross-chain verification

## Developer Experience Improvements

### P-Chain Native Transfers (ACP-23)

Users can now transfer assets between P-Chain addresses more efficiently using BaseTx, simplifying P-Chain operations and reducing transaction complexity.

### Subnet Ownership Transfer (ACP-31)

Subnet owners can transfer ownership through TransferSubnetOwnershipTx, enabling periodic control key rotation and improved security practices.

### Ethereum Compatibility (ACP-24)

ACP-24 incorporates Shanghai Upgrade changes, adding the PUSH0 opcode for compatibility with Solidity versions ≥ 0.8.20. This ensures Avalanche C-Chain and Subnets remain compatible with the latest Ethereum development tools and compiler versions.

### VM Application Errors (ACP-25)

ACP-25 allows peers to signal failures early, reducing latency from the network timeout (~2s) to a single network round trip time (~500ms). This improvement significantly enhances application responsiveness and user experience.

## P-Chain Scalability Enhancements

### Removal of Pending Stakers (ACP-41)

ACP-41 removes user-specified StartTime for stakers, having transactions define staking period start instead. This approach **greatly reduces the computation load on the P-Chain** and prepares for future upgrades including continuous staking.

### Impact on Network Performance

- **Reduced Computation**: Eliminates pending staker queue processing overhead
- **Simplified Staking**: Streamlined validator and delegator onboarding
- **Future-Ready**: Prepares infrastructure for continuous staking mechanisms

## Path to 100k Subnets

The upgrade supports the "Path to 100k Subnets" through BLS key adoption, enabling:

### Arbitrary Subnet Rewards
Custom reward curves and conditions for subnet validators, allowing flexible tokenomics and incentive structures.

### Subnet Attestations
Subnet state verification via BLS Multi-Signature without full synchronization, enabling lightweight validation and cross-chain state proofs.

## Upgrade Requirements

### Node Operators

**IMPORTANT**: Node operators must upgrade to AvalancheGo v1.11.0 or later before March 6, 2024. This upgrade is mandatory for Mainnet participation.

### Validators

Validators who fail to upgrade before the activation deadline will be unable to participate in consensus and may lose rewards.

### Developers

The upgrade includes backward-compatible changes, but developers building cross-chain applications should familiarize themselves with the new AWM APIs and capabilities.

## What This Means for the Ecosystem

The Durango upgrade represents a major milestone in Avalanche's cross-chain vision:

1. **Native Interoperability**: First-class cross-chain communication without bridges
2. **Enhanced Security**: Trust-minimized messaging secured by validator sets
3. **Developer Productivity**: Improved error handling and Solidity compatibility
4. **Subnet Scalability**: Foundation for massive subnet ecosystem growth

## Resources

- **Node Operators**: Upgrade to AvalancheGo v1.11.0+ before March 6, 2024
- **Developers**: Explore AWM documentation and integration guides
- **Community**: Join discussions about cross-chain applications in the Avalanche Discord
