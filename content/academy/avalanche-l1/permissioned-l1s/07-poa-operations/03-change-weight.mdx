Changing a validator's weight adjusts their influence in consensus. This operation follows the same two-phase pattern as adding a validator, with multi-sig approval required for each phase.

## When to Change Weight

Common reasons to adjust validator weights:

- **Performance-based**: Reward well-performing validators with higher weight
- **Governance adjustments**: Rebalance influence among validators
- **Scaling**: Increase weight as a validator proves reliable
- **Temporary reduction**: Lower weight during maintenance or issues

## Prerequisites

- ✅ The validator must be in **Active** status
- ✅ New weight must respect churn limits
- ✅ Access to your Safe wallet with required signers

## Phase 1: Initiate Weight Change

<Steps>
<Step>

### Identify the Validator

You'll need the **Validation ID** of the validator whose weight you want to change. 

Get this from:
- The [Query Validator Set tool](/academy/permissioned-l1s/05-validator-manager-operations/02-query-validator-set)
- Previous transaction records
- Your validator management documentation

</Step>
<Step>

### Access Your Safe Wallet

1. Go to [wallet.ash.center](https://wallet.ash.center/)
2. Connect and select your Safe
3. Navigate to **"New Transaction"** → **"Transaction Builder"**

</Step>
<Step>

### Configure the Transaction

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **To Address** | Your PoA Manager address |
| **Value** | 0 |
| **Contract Method** | `changeValidatorWeight` |

**Parameters:**
- **Validation ID**: The unique identifier of the validator
- **New Weight**: The desired new weight value

</Step>
<Step>

### Submit and Collect Approvals

1. Review the transaction parameters
2. Submit the transaction
3. Coordinate with signers for approvals
4. Wait for threshold to be reached

</Step>
<Step>

### Execute the Transaction

Once approved:

1. Execute the transaction
2. Wait for confirmation
3. A Warp message is sent to the P-Chain

</Step>
</Steps>

## Phase 2: Complete Weight Change

<Steps>
<Step>

### Wait for P-Chain Processing

The P-Chain processes the weight update and returns a signed acknowledgment.

</Step>
<Step>

### Prepare Completion Transaction

In your Safe wallet:

1. Create a new transaction
2. Target your PoA Manager
3. Call `completeValidatorWeightUpdate`
4. Provide the message index

</Step>
<Step>

### Collect Approvals and Execute

Same approval process:

1. Submit the transaction
2. Collect signer approvals
3. Execute when threshold is reached

</Step>
</Steps>

## Churn Limits

<Callout type="warning">
Weight changes are subject to **churn limits** set during VMC initialization. You cannot change more than the maximum churn percentage of total weight within the churn period.
</Callout>

### Understanding Churn

| Setting | Description | Typical Value |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Churn Period** | Time window for tracking changes | 24 hours (86400 seconds) |
| **Max Churn %** | Maximum weight change allowed per period | 20% |

**Example**: If total weight is 1000 and max churn is 20%, you can only change up to 200 weight units per period.

### Handling Churn Errors

If your weight change exceeds churn limits:

1. **Wait**: The churn period will reset
2. **Smaller Changes**: Break into multiple smaller changes
3. **Plan Ahead**: Schedule large changes across multiple periods

## Verification

After completion:

1. Query the validator set to confirm the new weight
2. Verify in block explorer or contract read
3. Monitor consensus participation with new weight
