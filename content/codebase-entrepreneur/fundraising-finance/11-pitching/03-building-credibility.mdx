Early-stage founders often feel pressure to oversell their progress to appear credible. However, honesty about your current stage is more persuasive than exaggeration. Own where you are in your founder journey while demonstrating your dedication through research, community engagement, and a clear vision.

Frame your journey using the Context, Content, and Climb structure:
- Context: Market positioning, differentiation, outreach efforts, and social proof
- Content: User journey and expected outcomes 
- Climb: Short-term concrete actions plus long-term projections

Throughout your pitch, highlight one core unique insight that only your team can deliver. This demonstrates your special understanding of the problem space and positions you as the right team to execute the solution.
