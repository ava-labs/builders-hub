# Rate Limits

Rate limiting is managed through a weighted scoring system, known as Compute Units (CUs). Each API request consumes a specified number of CUs, determined by the complexity of the request. This system is designed to accommodate basic requests while efficiently handling more computationally intensive operations.

## Rate Limit Tiers

The maximum CUs (rate-limiting score) for a user depends on their subscription level and is delineated in the following table:

| Subscription Level | Per Minute Limit (CUs) | Per Day Limit (CUs) |
| :----------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------ |
| Free               | 8,000                  | 1,200,000           |

> We are working on new subscription tiers with higher rate limits to support even greater request volumes.

## Rate Limit Categories

The CUs for each category are defined in the following table:

| Weight | CU Value |
| :----- | :------- |
| Free   | 1        |
| Small  | 20       |
| Medium | 100      |
| Large  | 500      |
| XL     | 1000     |
| XXL    | 3000     |

## Rate Limits for Metrics Endpoints

The CUs for each route are defined in the table below:

| Endpoint                                                    | Method | Weight | CU Value |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :----- | :----- | :------- |

| `/v2/chains`                                                | GET    | Free   | 1        |
| `/v2/chains/{chainId}`                                      | GET    | Free   | 1        |
