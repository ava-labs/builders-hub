# Native to ERC-20 Token Bridge

In this section, you'll learn how to bridge native tokens from a source chain to a destination chain, where they'll be represented as **ERC-20 tokens**.

## Use Case

This bridge type is ideal when:

- You want to use your L1's native token on chains that **don't have the Native Minter precompile**
- You prefer ERC-20 tokens for **DeFi integrations** (most DeFi protocols work with ERC-20)
- You want **simpler deployment** (no precompile requirements on destination)

## Architecture Overview

```
Source Chain (e.g., Fuji C-Chain)          Destination Chain (e.g., Echo)
┌──────────────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────────────┐
│                              │          │                              │
│  Native Token (AVAX)         │          │  ERC-20 Token (bridged AVAX) │
│       ↓                      │          │       ↑                      │
│  Wrapped Token (WAVAX)       │          │       │                      │
│       ↓                      │    ICM   │       │                      │
│  NativeTokenHome   ──────────│────────▶ │  ERC20TokenRemote            │
│                              │          │                              │
└──────────────────────────────┘          └──────────────────────────────┘
```

## Contracts Involved

| Contract | Chain | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **WrappedNativeToken** | Source | ERC-20 wrapper for native tokens |
| **NativeTokenHome** | Source | Holds wrapped tokens as collateral, manages bridge state |
| **ERC20TokenRemote** | Destination | Mints/burns ERC-20 tokens representing bridged assets |

## Deployment Flow

Here's the step-by-step process we'll follow:

### Step 1: Ensure Wrapped Native Token Exists

Before deploying the bridge, verify you have a wrapped native token on the source chain. On Fuji, **WAVAX** is already available.

### Step 2: Deploy NativeTokenHome

Deploy the `NativeTokenHome` contract on the source chain. This contract:
- References your wrapped native token
- Locks wrapped tokens when bridging out
- Releases wrapped tokens when bridging back
- Communicates with remote contracts via ICM

### Step 3: Deploy ERC20TokenRemote

Deploy the `ERC20TokenRemote` contract on the destination chain. This contract:
- References the home contract's blockchain ID and address
- Mints ERC-20 tokens when tokens are bridged in
- Burns ERC-20 tokens when bridging back to the source

### Step 4: Register Remote with Home

The remote contract must register itself with the home contract. This creates a secure, bidirectional connection between the contracts.

### Step 5: Bridge Tokens

Once registered, you can:
- **Send tokens**: Lock native tokens on source, mint ERC-20 on destination
- **Receive tokens**: Burn ERC-20 on destination, unlock native tokens on source

## What You'll Build

In this section, we'll bridge **AVAX** from the **Fuji C-Chain** to **Echo** as an ERC-20 token:

| Step | Action | Chain |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Deploy NativeTokenHome | Fuji C-Chain |
| 2 | Deploy ERC20TokenRemote | Echo |
| 3 | Register Remote with Home | Echo |
| 4 | Transfer tokens | Fuji → Echo |

## Key Concepts

<Callout type="info">
**Token Backing**: Every ERC-20 token minted on the destination chain is backed 1:1 by wrapped native tokens locked in the NativeTokenHome contract.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**No Collateral Required**: Unlike NativeTokenRemote, the ERC20TokenRemote doesn't require initial collateral because it only mints ERC-20 tokens, not native tokens.
</Callout>

Let's get started with deploying the NativeTokenHome contract!
