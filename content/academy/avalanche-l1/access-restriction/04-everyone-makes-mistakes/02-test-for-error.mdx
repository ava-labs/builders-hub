## Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

- Verify you can no longer submit transactions after removing your transactor permissions
- Verify you can no longer deploy contracts after removing your deployer permissions
- Recognize the failure modes users will see in wallets and dApps

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

- Completed the previous lesson and removed your wallet from **Admin** on both allowlist precompiles
- Still connected to your L1 in Core Wallet

## Instructions

import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/toolbox/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx";

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Step 1: Attempt a normal transaction (should fail)

    In your Core Wallet browser extension:

    1. Stay on your L1 network
    2. Try to send a small amount of the native token to any address you control
    3. Confirm the transaction

    You should see a failure/revert because the **Transaction AllowList** blocks your address from submitting transactions.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 2: Attempt a contract deployment (should fail)

    Use the ICM demo deploy tool (any deployment attempt works — we’re just testing deploy restrictions):

    <ToolboxMdxWrapper>
      <DeployICMDemo />
    </ToolboxMdxWrapper>

    When you try to deploy, the transaction should fail because the **Contract Deployer AllowList** blocks your address from deploying contracts.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 3: Record what you observed

    Note the exact error messages you see in:

    - Core Wallet
    - Console UI (if any)

    These are the same user-facing symptoms you must plan for when operating a restricted-access L1.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expected Output

You should see:

- A failed **value transfer transaction** (blocked by Transaction AllowList)
- A failed **contract deployment** (blocked by Contract Deployer AllowList)

## Verification

To verify you've completed this exercise successfully:

1. You cannot send transactions from your wallet on the L1
2. You cannot deploy a contract from your wallet on the L1

## Troubleshooting

### My transaction still succeeds

- You likely still have **Enabled** access on the Transaction AllowList (or you didn’t enable it at genesis).
- Verify the precompile is enabled and your role is **None**.

## Next Steps

Next we’ll cover how to safely recover from mistakes like this using network upgrades (enable/disable + role recovery).
