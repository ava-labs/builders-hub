1. **Start with the right legal foundation**: Select a jurisdiction that supports Web3 innovation.

2. **Budget appropriately for legal setup**: Allocate sufficient funds for initial legal documentation and IP protection.

3. **Be meticulous about token classification**: Consult legal experts to determine if your token is a utility or security before launch.

4. **Protect your intellectual property**: Implement comprehensive IP protections, especially when working with contractors or open-source contributors.

5. **Simplify compliance**: Use third-party platforms to handle KYC/AML requirements rather than building these systems from scratch.

6. **Consider regulation**: If offering security tokens, evaluate a pathway for compliant fundraising.

7. **Review local jurisdiction requirements**: Different regions have varying approaches to crypto regulationâ€”understand the implications for your specific project.
