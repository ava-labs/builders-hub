### Getting Noticed

To gain attention in crowded markets, focus your efforts on one or two primary social channels. For B2B sales, LinkedIn typically works best, while crypto-native projects might find more traction on X (Twitter).

Engage with key stakeholders by responding thoughtfully to their posts. This approach builds visibility in recommendation algorithms while demonstrating your expertise and interest.

Create two distinct types of content:
- Awareness content: Educational material that showcases your knowledge without direct sales pitches
- Conversion content: Targeted messaging designed to move specific prospects toward purchase decisions

Mixing these approaches reduces effectiveness—keep each piece of content focused on either building awareness or driving conversion.

### Structuring Sales Calls

Follow a simple framework for sales calls: "Tell them what you'll tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them."

Begin with a brief introduction explaining your founding journey and the problem you're solving. Outline how the call will proceed and get the prospect's agreement on the structure.

Prioritize asking questions about their pain points before presenting your solution. Allow prospects to speak more than you do—people enjoy talking about their challenges, and their responses often reveal unexpected insights that can reshape your approach.

Practice active listening rather than rigidly following a script. When prospects mention a problem area, ask follow-up questions instead of immediately redirecting to your planned pitch.

Build personal connections that make prospects root for your success. In early-stage startups, customers often buy into the founder's vision as much as the product itself.
