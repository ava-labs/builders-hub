1. **Find meaningful use cases**: Focus on communities where blockchain genuinely solves problems around visibility, access, or ownershipâ€”not where it's just trendy.

2. **Engage personally**: Invest time in direct relationships with users, making them feel like collaborators rather than just customers.

3. **Document systematically**: Create a structured process for collecting, analyzing, and prioritizing user feedback.

4. **Implement visibly**: Show users their feedback matters by quickly implementing high-impact, low-effort changes.

5. **Be ready to pivot**: The most successful founders maintain the ability to reinvent their approach when user feedback indicates a different direction.

6. **Balance listening and leading**: While user feedback is essential, also recognize opportunities to create needs users haven't yet imagined.
