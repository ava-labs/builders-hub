## Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

- Restart your validator container to load the new upgrade entries.
- Validate in logs that the node parsed your appended `precompileUpgrades`.
- Recover from common startup failures (past timestamps / modified old entries).

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

- Appended the re-activation entries to `upgrade.json` (previous lesson).
- Access to run Docker commands on the host machine.

## Instructions

import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Step 1: Restart the validator container

    Restart the container:

    ```bash
    docker restart <YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 2: Follow logs and confirm the upgrade config is present

    Stream logs while it comes up:

    ```bash
    docker logs -f <YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID>
    ```

    You’re looking for startup output that includes the `UpgradeConfig` and shows your `precompileUpgrades` list (now containing both disables and enables).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 3: Wait for activation timestamps to pass

    These upgrades apply when the chain accepts a block after the specified timestamps. If you set the timestamps to “now + 10 minutes”, you may need to wait a few minutes before the precompiles appear active again.

    <Callout type="info">
    If the node fails to start, the two most common causes are:
    - a `blockTimestamp` that is in the past, or
    - modifying/removing previously activated upgrades (not append-only).
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expected Output

Your container is running, and logs show the node parsed the upgrade config with your appended enable entries.

```
... Initialised chain configuration ... UpgradeConfig: {"precompileUpgrades":[ ... ]}
```

## Verification

To verify you've completed this exercise successfully:

1. The validator container is healthy and producing blocks.
2. The log output includes your upgrade list with the new enable entries.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: The node fails on startup

**Problem**: Startup errors after editing `upgrade.json`.

**Solution**:
- Ensure the newest timestamps are still **in the future** relative to the chain head.
- Ensure you did not change older entries after they activated (treat the list as append-only).

## Next Steps

Next, you’ll verify re-activation in the Builder Console and test that you can manage the allowlists again.
