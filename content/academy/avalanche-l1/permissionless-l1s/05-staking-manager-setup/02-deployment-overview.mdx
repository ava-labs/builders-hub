<Callout type="info">
**For this course**, we will be implementing the **NativeTokenStakingManager** deployed on your L1, using the **native token as the staking token**. 

Reminder that you could alternatively use an ERC20 as your chains staking token (via `ERC20TokenStakingManager`) and the Validator Manager deployed on another L1.
</Callout>

The following steps will guide you through deploying and configuring a `NativeTokenStakingManager`:

<Steps>
<Step>

### [Deploy Staking Manager](/academy/permissionless-l1s/05-staking-manager-setup/02-deploy-staking-manager)

Deploy the `NativeTokenStakingManager` implementation contract to your L1.

</Step>
<Step>

### [Deploy Reward Calculator](/academy/permissionless-l1s/05-staking-manager-setup/03-deploy-reward-calculator)

Deploy the `ExampleRewardCalculator` contract that will determine how staking rewards are distributed based on validator uptime.

</Step>
<Step>

### [Initialize Staking Manager](/academy/permissionless-l1s/05-staking-manager-setup/04-initialize-staking-manager)

Call the `initialize` function with `PoSValidatorManagerSettings` to configure staking parameters (minimum stake, duration, delegation fees, etc.).

</Step>
<Step>

### [Enable in Native Minter](/academy/permissionless-l1s/05-staking-manager-setup/05-enable-native-minter)

Add the Staking Manager address as an **Enabled** address on the Native Minter precompile so it can mint reward tokens.

</Step>
<Step>

### [Transfer Ownership](/academy/permissionless-l1s/05-staking-manager-setup/06-transfer-ownership)

Transfer ownership of the Reward Manager precompile to the Staking Manager so it can distribute rewards to validators and delegators.

</Step>
<Step>

### [Verify Configuration](/academy/permissionless-l1s/05-staking-manager-setup/07-read-contract)

Read the contract state to verify all configuration parameters are set correctly.

</Step>
</Steps>

Happy Building!
