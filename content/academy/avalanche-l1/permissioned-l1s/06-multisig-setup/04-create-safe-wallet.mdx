Before deploying the PoA Manager, you need a multi-signature wallet that will own and control it. We recommend using **Ash Wallet** (built on Safe infrastructure) for the best Avalanche integration.

## Why Multi-Sig?

A multi-signature wallet requires multiple parties to approve transactions before execution. This is crucial for validator management because:

- **No Single Point of Failure**: No single key can add/remove validators
- **Governance by Committee**: Multiple stakeholders must agree on validator changes
- **Audit Trail**: All operations are transparent and require explicit approval
- **Recovery Options**: If one key is compromised, the system remains secure

## Multi-Sig Options

### Option 1: Ash Wallet (Recommended)

[Ash Wallet](https://wallet.ash.center/) is a Safe-based multi-sig specifically designed for Avalanche. It provides:

- Native Avalanche L1 support
- Easy network configuration for custom L1s
- Familiar Safe interface
- Better tooling integration with Builder Hub

### Option 2: Safe Global

[Safe](https://safe.global/) is the industry-standard multi-sig solution. You can use it on Avalanche C-Chain directly.

For this course, we'll use **Ash Wallet** as it's specifically built for Avalanche and has the best support for L1 operations.

## Creating Your Ash Wallet

<Steps>
<Step>

### Navigate to Ash Wallet

Go to [https://wallet.ash.center/](https://wallet.ash.center/) and connect your wallet.

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you're on the **Avalanche Fuji Testnet** for this tutorial.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

### Create New Safe

Click **"Create new Account"** and follow the prompts:

1. **Name**: Give your Safe a descriptive name (e.g., "MyL1 Validator Management")
2. **Network**: Select the network where your VMC is deployed (C-Chain for this setup)
3. **Signers**: Add the addresses that will be part of the multi-sig

</Step>
<Step>

### Configure Signers

Add the wallet addresses that will control validator operations:

**Example Configuration:**
- **Signer 1**: Your main operational wallet
- **Signer 2**: A hardware wallet for security
- **Signer 3**: A trusted partner or team member

</Step>
<Step>

### Set Threshold

The threshold determines how many signatures are required to execute a transaction:

| Threshold | Signers | Security Level | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|----------------|----------|
| 1 of 2 | 2 | Low | Testing/Development |
| 2 of 3 | 3 | Medium | Small teams |
| 3 of 5 | 5 | High | Production/Enterprise |

<Callout type="info">
**Recommended**: Start with a **2 of 3** configuration. This balances security with operational convenience.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

### Deploy the Safe

Click **"Create"** to deploy your Safe wallet. This will:

1. Submit a transaction to deploy the Safe contract
2. Register your signers
3. Set the approval threshold

**Wait for the transaction to confirm** before proceeding.

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify Your Safe

Once deployed, you should see:

- ✅ Your Safe address (copy this - you'll need it!)
- ✅ List of signers
- ✅ Current threshold
- ✅ Transaction history (empty for now)

</Step>
</Steps>

## Important Details to Note

After creating your Safe, record these details:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Safe Address** | The multi-sig contract address | `0x1234...abcd` |
| **Threshold** | Required signatures | `2 of 3` |
| **Signers** | Owner addresses | `0xOwner1, 0xOwner2, 0xOwner3` |
| **Network** | Where the Safe is deployed | `Avalanche Fuji C-Chain` |

## Best Practices

### Signer Selection

- **Use different wallet types**: Mix browser wallets, hardware wallets, and mobile wallets
- **Geographic distribution**: Signers in different locations for disaster recovery
- **Operational availability**: Ensure signers are available when needed

### Security Considerations

- **Test first**: Create a test Safe and practice with small transactions
- **Document procedures**: Create runbooks for common operations
- **Regular reviews**: Periodically review signer access and threshold settings

## Next Steps

With your Safe wallet created, you're ready to:

1. Deploy the PoA Manager with the Safe as owner
2. Transfer Validator Manager ownership to the PoA Manager
3. Begin multi-sig validator operations

In the next section, we'll deploy the PoA Manager contract.
