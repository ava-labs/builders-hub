When creating a custom native token for your Avalanche L1, choosing the right token symbol is more important than it might initially seem. A token symbol serves as the shorthand identifier for your token across wallets, exchanges, and applications.

## Symbol Conventions

Token symbols typically follow these conventions:
- **Length**: 3-5 characters (ETH, AVAX, USDC, BTC)
- **Format**: All uppercase letters
- **Uniqueness**: Should be distinct from existing popular tokens
- **Relevance**: Often relates to the project name or purpose

## Native Token Symbol in Code

In Solidity and other EVM-based smart contracts, there's an important convention to understand. The native token is always referred to as **"ether"** in the code, regardless of what the actual token symbol is on your blockchain.

For example:
```solidity
// This always refers to the native token, whether it's ETH, AVAX, or your custom token
msg.value // Amount of native token sent
address.balance // Native token balance
payable(recipient).transfer(1 ether) // Transfer 1 unit of native token
```

This convention exists because Solidity was originally designed for Ethereum, where the native token is Ether. The keyword "ether" became a unit denomination in the language itself.

## Custom L1 Considerations

When launching your Avalanche L1:
- Your chosen symbol (e.g., "GAME", "DEFI") is what users see in wallets and explorers
- But in smart contract code, you'll still use "ether" as the unit
- This separation between display symbol and code convention helps maintain compatibility

## Best Practices

1. **Research existing symbols** to avoid conflicts
2. **Keep it memorable** and easy to type
3. **Consider your brand** - the symbol becomes part of your identity
4. **Check trademark considerations** for your chosen symbol

Your token symbol is often the first thing users encounter, so choose wisely!
