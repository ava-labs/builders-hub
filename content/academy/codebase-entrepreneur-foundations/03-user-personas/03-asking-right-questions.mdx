When engaging with potential users, focus on understanding:
- What problems they're experiencing with current solutions
- What gaps exist in current offerings
- What similar tools they're using as workarounds

Remember that while listening to complaints is valuable, successful founders also anticipate needs users haven't yet articulated. The most impactful products often create new behaviors rather than just addressing existing complaints.

The real opportunity lies in creating solutions users haven't yet imagined.

### Getting Honest Feedback

To ensure users provide honest feedback rather than just being polite, build a collaborative culture where they feel like partners in your project. Position them as collaborators and ambassadors rather than just test subjects.

When users feel invested in your product's success, they become more willing to provide critical feedback because they genuinely want the product to improveâ€”both for themselves and so they can recommend it to others.

Engaged users will be patient with bugs and development issues, but will also apply healthy pressure to fix problems that might prevent wider adoption.
