<Callout>
For this guide, we'll be using the Avalanche Fuji testnet, which already has a wrapped native asset (WAVAX). If you're creating your own L1 blockchain, you'll need to deploy your own wrapped native asset first.

### Deploy NativeTokenHome

Use our toolbox to deploy the NativeTokenHome contract:

<Callout>
Make sure you have:
1. Connected your Core Wallet to the Fuji testnet
2. Have enough test AVAX for gas fees
3. Select "Native Token" as the transferrer type in the toolbox
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <DeployTokenHome />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>
</Step>

### Save the Native Token Home Address

After deployment, you'll need to save the contract address for future steps. You can find it in the deployment confirmation in the toolbox.

Keep this address handy as you'll need it for the next steps in the bridging process.
