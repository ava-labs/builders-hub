## Removing a Validator

You're removing an existing Active validator in a PoA setup where the `ValidatorManager` contract is owned by an EOA. The flow has two L1 calls with P-Chain processing in between.

### Phase 1: Initiation (L1)

The owner calls `initiateValidatorRemoval(validationID)` on `ValidatorManager`.

Under the hood, the contract:
- Ensures the validator is currently Active
- Sets the validator status to `PendingRemoved`
- Sets the end time of the current validation period to the current timestamp
- Persists updates and constructs a weight message with `weight = 0`
- Sends a Warp message to the P-Chain (removal is encoded as a weight update to zero)

### Phase 2: P-Chain Processing

We then will sign and submit the `L1ValidatorWeightMessage` warped response we got from the last step to the P-Chain, this executes a `SetL1ValidatorWeightTx`. Upon successful processing, it acknowledges the validator exit by signing and returns an `L1ValidatorRegistrationMessage` with `valid = 0` warped response.

### Phase 3: Completion (L1)

We finally will call the `completeValidatorRemoval(message)`, where we will sign and submit as the message the response we received in step 2. The contract verifies the Warp message, confirms the registration status is false, updates the validator's status to Completed (if previously `PendingRemoved`), removes the node from the registered mapping, persists updates, and emits `CompletedValidatorRemoval`.

Anyone can call the `completeValidatorRemoval(message)` with the signed message.
