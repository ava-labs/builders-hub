Usage-based pricing has become a well-established model in SaaS, valued for its flexibility and alignment with customer activity. 

For Web3 projects, combining usage-based elements with other pricing models can create a balanced approach that supports both user adoption and sustainable revenue. Here are some different models:

**Hybrid Model:** Combines a fixed subscription fee as a base with variable usage charges for technical components like transactions or storage. This approach aligns costs with actual usage while providing predictable baseline revenue.

**Tiered Pricing:** Offers a free tier up to a certain threshold, then basic/pro/enterprise options with increasing features. This model helps users try your service with minimal commitment before upgrading.

**Pure Usage-Based:** Charges directly per transaction or user, creating perfect alignment between costs and revenue but potentially less predictability.
