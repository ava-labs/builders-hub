## Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

- Create an Avalanche L1 record in Builder Console with a custom genesis
- Enable **Transaction AllowList** and **Contract Deployer AllowList** at genesis
- Run a self-hosted node via Docker and connect Core Wallet to your L1

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

- Core Wallet installed and set to the correct network mode
- Docker installed and running locally
- A funded wallet (testnet AVAX) to create the Subnet + Chain transactions

## Instructions

import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/toolbox/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx";
import AvalancheGoDocker from "@/components/toolbox/console/layer-1/AvalancheGoDockerL1";
import CreateChain from "@/components/toolbox/console/layer-1/create/CreateChain";

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Step 1: Create the Subnet + Chain in Console

    Use Builder Console to create the Subnet and then create your chain. You’ll edit the **Genesis JSON** before finalizing.

    <ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
      <CreateChain embedded={true} />
    </ToolboxMdxWrapper>

    In **Step 2: Create a Chain**, open the **Genesis JSON** tab and add the two allowlist configs under `config`:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "txAllowListConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x...YOUR_WALLET_EVM_ADDRESS"]
    },
    "contractDeployerAllowListConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x...YOUR_WALLET_EVM_ADDRESS"]
    }
  }
}
```

    <Callout type="warning">
      If you enable these allowlists but do not include your own wallet as an admin at genesis, you can immediately lock yourself out of the network.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 2: Run a self-hosted node (Docker)

    This course does **not** use BuilderHub-managed nodes. Run your node locally with Docker so you control startup flags and can restart easily during troubleshooting.

    <ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="testnet-mainnet">
      <AvalancheGoDocker />
    </ToolboxMdxWrapper>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 3: Connect Core Wallet and verify precompiles are active

    Once your node is running and you’ve added the network to Core Wallet:

    - Try sending a simple transaction (it should succeed for your admin wallet)
    - Confirm the precompiles are reachable at:
      - Transaction AllowList: `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000002`
      - Contract Deployer AllowList: `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expected Output

You should have:

- A running L1 node (Docker)
- Core Wallet connected to your L1
- Both allowlist precompiles enabled from genesis

## Verification

To verify you've completed this exercise successfully:

1. Your wallet can send a transaction on the L1
2. You can open the allowlist consoles in the next section and view your role as **Admin**

## Troubleshooting

### I can’t send transactions after enabling the allowlist

- Ensure your wallet address is included in `txAllowListConfig.adminAddresses` at genesis.

### I can’t deploy contracts after enabling the deployer allowlist

- Ensure your wallet address is included in `contractDeployerAllowListConfig.adminAddresses` at genesis.

## Next Steps

Next, we’ll start interacting with these precompiles and then intentionally break permissions to learn recovery patterns.
