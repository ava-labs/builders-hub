This section provides a streamlined walkthrough for creating a new L1 from scratch.  

You should already have a created L1 from the [Permissioned L1 course] with the Validator Manager Contract correctly set up that you can use to transform into a Permissionless L1.

## Step 1: Create Subnet with correct Precompiles

When creating your subnet, you **must** enable the Native Minter and Reward Manager precompiles in your genesis configuration. These are essential for native token staking:

- **Native Minter**: Allows the staking manager to mint reward tokens
- **Reward Manager**: Automates reward distribution to validators

Make sure to enable both precompiles during subnet creation. You can use the Developer Console to configure these settings.

## Step 2: Add Initial Validator

Your subnet needs at least one validator to operate. You can either:
- Use a BuilderHub hosted node (recommended for testing)
- Run your own validator node

The validator you add here will become part of your L1's initial validator set after conversion.

## Step 3: Convert Subnet to L1

Once your subnet is running with a validator, convert it to a sovereign L1. This process:

- **Establishes Sovereignty**: Your blockchain becomes independent
- **Transfers Authority**: Validator management shifts from P-Chain to your Validator Manager Contract
- **Is Irreversible**: Once converted, you cannot revert to subnet status

### Key Conversion Parameters

1. **Subnet ID**: Your subnet's unique identifier
2. **Validator Manager Blockchain ID**: Where your VMC will be deployed (typically your L1)
3. **Validator Manager Address**: The proxy address (usually `0xfacade0000000000000000000000000000000000`)
4. **Initial Validators**: The validator(s) from your subnet

    <ConvertSubnetToL1 />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## Next Steps

Now that your L1 is created with the required precompiles, you're ready to deploy and configure your Validator Manager Contract.
