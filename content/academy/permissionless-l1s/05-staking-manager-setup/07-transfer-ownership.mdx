Transfer ownership of the Reward Manager precompile to the Staking Manager contract so it can distribute rewards.

## Why Transfer Ownership?

The Staking Manager needs to be able to call the Reward Manager precompile to:
- Distribute validator rewards based on uptime
- Handle delegator reward distribution
- Manage delegation fees

By setting the Staking Manager as the owner of the Reward Manager, it gains the necessary permissions.

<Callout type="info">
This is a one-time operation. Make sure the Staking Manager address is correct before transferring ownership.
</Callout>

## Transfer Ownership

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="l1">
    <TransferOwnershipToStakingManager />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## Next Steps

After transferring ownership, you can verify the configuration by reading the contract state.
