# Register Remote with Home

Before you can bridge tokens, you need to register the ERC20TokenRemote with the NativeTokenHome. This establishes a secure connection between the contracts.

## Why Registration?

Registration:

- Creates a **bidirectional link** between home and remote contracts
- Prevents **unauthorized remote contracts** from claiming tokens
- Is a **one-time setup** per remote contract

<Steps>
<Step>
### Switch to C-Chain

Ensure your wallet is connected to **Fuji C-Chain** (where ERC20TokenRemote is deployed).

</Step>

<Step>
### Register the Remote

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Successfully deployed ERC20TokenRemote on C-Chain
2. Test AVAX for gas fees
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <RegisterWithHome />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Bridge State After Registration

After completing registration:

- ✅ ERC20TokenRemote is registered with NativeTokenHome
- ✅ Your L1's native token can now be bridged to C-Chain as ERC-20
- ✅ ERC-20 tokens can be bridged back to your L1 as native tokens

<Callout type="info">
Unlike native-token bridges (Chapters 1 and 3), this bridge does **not** require collateralization. The home contract simply locks tokens on one side and the remote mints on the other.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

Your bridge is fully configured! Let's test it by bridging some tokens.
