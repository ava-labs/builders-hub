When working with enterprise clients:

**Price Buffering:** Build in margin for strategic discounts while maintaining profit expectations. Multi-year contracts provide better revenue predictability.

**Value-Based Framing:** Focus conversations on ROI and strategic impact rather than unit pricing. Emphasize how your solution solves specific business problems.

**Alternative Value Levers:** Instead of pure discounts, offer enhanced support, dedicated onboarding, or custom SLAs to maintain pricing integrity while providing added value.
