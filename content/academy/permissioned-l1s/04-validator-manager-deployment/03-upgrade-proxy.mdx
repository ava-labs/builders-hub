After deploying both the the validator manager contract, we will need to link them by upgrading the proxy to point to your Validator Manager implementation.

Since the **ProxyAdmin** contract was deployed through the genesis with the deployer address set to the owner of the contract, we will call the *upgradeToAndCall()* function.

This will cause the **TransparentUpgradeableProxy** contract to (via *delegatecall*) call our newly deployed **Validator Manager** contract, instead of the empty contract it previously had set by default.

## Perform the Upgrade

- **Proxy Address**: set to 0xfacade...
- **ProxyAdmin Address**: set to 0xdad....
- **Desired Implementation**: set to address of deployed Validator Manager contract on your L1
- **Current Implementation**: set to 0x121212...212
