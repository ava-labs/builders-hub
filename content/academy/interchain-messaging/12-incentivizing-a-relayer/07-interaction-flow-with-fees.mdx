Now we have all the Smart Contract ðŸ“œ set we can start sending incentivized cross-chain messages. Now let complete the flow 

- Deploy sender contract on **C-Chain**
- Deploy receiver contract on **Dispatch**
- Approve the sender contract to spend ERC20 funds from the message sender address
- Send the message

<Steps>
<Step>

### Deploy Sender Contract 

To deploy the sender contract run:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url fuji-c --private-key $PK contracts/interchain-messaging/incentivize-relayer/senderWithFees.sol:SenderWithFeesOnCChain --broadcast
```

```bash {6}
[â Š] Compiling...
[â ’] Compiling 2 files with Solc 0.8.18
[â ¢] Solc 0.8.18 finished in 92.98ms
Compiler run successful!

Deployed to: 0xa4DfF80B4a1D748BF28BC4A271eD834689Ea3407
Transaction hash: 0xb0ff20527818fcc0836944a13ddb3b336b95047d434bb52f6c064ab407950166
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Save the Sender Contract Address

```bash
export SENDER_ADDRESS=0xa4DfF80B4a1D748BF28BC4A271eD834689Ea3407
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Deploy Receiver Contract

Now, deploy the receiver contract.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url fuji-dispatch --private-key $PK contracts/interchain-messaging/incentivize-relayer/receiverWithFees.sol:ReceiverOnDispatch --broadcast
```

```bash {6}
[â Š] Compiling...
[â ¢] Compiling 1 files with Solc 0.8.18

Deployed to: 0xe336d36FacA76840407e6836d26119E1EcE0A2b4

```

</Step>
<Step>

### Save the Receiver Contract Address

```bash
export RECEIVER_ADDRESS=0xe336d36FacA76840407e6836d26119E1EcE0A2b4
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Approve ERC20 Token Expense

ðŸ‘© The Message Sender (User) requires to approve the Cross-Avalanche L1 dApp as a spender on the ERC20 contract to be used as fee. We'll approve 0.0005 tokens (500000000000000 wei) from your total supply of 1,000,000 tokens which matches the fee amount set in the sender contract.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url fuji-c --private-key $PK $FEE_TOKEN_ADDRESS "approve(address,uint256)" $SENDER_ADDRESS 500000000000000
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Send an incentivized message

```bash
cast send --rpc-url fuji-c --private-key $PK $SENDER_ADDRESS "sendMessage(address, string, address)" $RECEIVER_ADDRESS "Hello" $FEE_TOKEN_ADDRESS
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify message was received on Avalanche L1 

```bash
cast call --rpc-url fuji-dispatch $RECEIVER_ADDRESS "lastMessage()(string)"
```
```bash
"Hello"
```

**Success!** The message was received on the destination chain while incentivizing the Relayer.
