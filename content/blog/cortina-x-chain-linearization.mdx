The Cortina upgrade addresses three core improvements: expanding X-Chain adoption potential, enhancing staking UX on the P-Chain, and enabling sophisticated transactions on the C-Chain. Activation occurred April 6, 2023 at 11 A.M. ET.

## X-Chain Linearization

The protocol transitions from DAG-based Avalanche Consensus to Snowman++ chain-based consensus, creating a totally-ordered blockchain. This migration enables Avalanche Warp Messaging integration and exchange compatibility while maintaining existing transaction APIs.

### Key Benefits

- **Exchange Compatibility**: The linearized X-Chain structure aligns with exchange infrastructure expectations
- **Warp Messaging Ready**: Prepares the X-Chain for future Avalanche Warp Messaging integration
- **API Consistency**: All existing transaction APIs remain unchanged

## Batched Delegator Rewards

Rather than distributing individual fee UTXOs per delegation period, the system now batches fees throughout validators' entire staking periods, distributing accumulated rewards upon unstaking.

### Advantages

- **Reduced UTXO Bloat**: Eliminates creation of thousands of small UTXOs for active validators
- **Improved Performance**: Streamlines reward distribution process
- **Better UX**: Delegators receive consolidated rewards at unstaking

## C-Chain Gas Limit Increase

Block gas limit raised from 8M to 15M gas, allowing more complex dApp transactions while preserving network resource requirements.

### Impact

- **Complex Transactions**: Enables more sophisticated smart contract operations per block
- **DeFi Support**: Better accommodates complex DeFi protocols and batch operations
- **No Hardware Changes**: Existing validator hardware specifications remain sufficient

## Upgrade Information

### Node Operators

Node upgrade process is identical to standard updates. Validators risk reward jeopardy if not upgraded before mainnet activation.

**Required Version**: AvalancheGo v1.10.0 or later

**Activation Date**: April 6, 2023 at 11:00 AM ET

### API Usage Example

### Hardware Requirements

No changes to hardware requirements. Validators can continue operating with existing infrastructure.

## What This Means for the Ecosystem

The Cortina upgrade represents a significant step in Avalanche's evolution:

1. **Broader Exchange Support**: Linearized X-Chain makes integration easier for centralized exchanges
2. **Foundation for Future Features**: Prepares infrastructure for Avalanche Warp Messaging
3. **Enhanced Scalability**: Improved reward system and increased gas limits support network growth
4. **Developer Flexibility**: Higher gas limits enable more complex smart contract interactions

## Resources

- **Node Operators**: Upgrade to AvalancheGo v1.10.0+ before April 6, 2023
- **Developers**: No API changes required for existing applications
- **Community**: Join discussions in the Avalanche Discord and developer forums
