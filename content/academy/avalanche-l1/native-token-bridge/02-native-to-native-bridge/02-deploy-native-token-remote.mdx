# Deploy NativeTokenRemote

The `NativeTokenRemote` contract is deployed on a destination chain that has the **Native Minter precompile** enabled. This contract can mint native tokens (used for gas) when users bridge from the source chain.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying NativeTokenRemote, ensure:

1. **Destination chain has Native Minter precompile enabled**
2. **NativeTokenHome is deployed** on the source chain
3. **You have gas tokens** on the destination chain

<Callout type="warning">
The Native Minter precompile must be enabled on your destination chain. This is typically configured in the chain's genesis file or via a network upgrade. Standard chains like C-Chain do NOT have this enabled.
</Callout>

## Understanding NativeTokenRemote

The NativeTokenRemote contract:

- **Mints native tokens** by calling the Native Minter precompile
- **Burns native tokens** when users bridge back to the source
- **Requires collateralization** before minting is enabled
- **Reports burned fees** back to the home contract for accounting

## Deployment Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Teleporter Registry** | ICM registry on the destination chain |
| **Teleporter Manager** | Address that can manage ICM settings |
| **Source Chain** | Blockchain ID where NativeTokenHome is deployed |
| **Token Home Address** | Your NativeTokenHome contract address |
| **Initial Reserve Imbalance** | Amount of collateral required before minting |
| **Burned Fees Reporting Reward** | Percentage rewarded for fee reporting (0-100) |

### Initial Reserve Imbalance

This is a critical parameter that determines how much collateral must be added before the bridge can mint tokens:

- **Set to 0**: Bridge works immediately, no collateral needed (less secure)
- **Set to amount**: That amount must be deposited as collateral first

<Callout type="info">
For production bridges, always set an initial reserve imbalance to ensure proper backing of minted tokens.
</Callout>

### Burned Fees Reporting Reward

When native tokens are used for gas and burned, this mechanism allows:
- Reporting burned fees back to the home contract
- Rewarding the reporter with a percentage of reported fees
- Keeping supply accounting accurate across chains

<Steps>
<Step>
### Switch to Destination Chain

Connect your wallet to a chain that has the **Native Minter precompile** enabled. 

The toolbox will automatically check if the precompile is active and show a warning if it's not.

</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy NativeTokenRemote

Use the Deploy Native Token Remote tool below:

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Connected to a chain with Native Minter precompile enabled
2. Sufficient gas tokens for deployment
3. Your NativeTokenHome address from the source chain
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
    <DeployNativeTokenRemote />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Acknowledge Chain Switching

The tool will ask you to confirm you're on the correct destination chain. This is important because:

- The contract MUST be on the destination chain
- You need the source chain's Token Home address
- Deploying on the wrong chain means starting over

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Deployment

Fill in the deployment parameters:

1. **Source Chain**: Select where your NativeTokenHome is deployed
2. **Token Home Address**: Enter or select your NativeTokenHome address
3. **Initial Reserve Imbalance**: Set to `0` for testing, or a specific amount for production
4. **Burned Fees Reporting Reward**: Usually `0` for testing

</Step>

<Step>
### Save the Contract Address

After deployment, save the **Native Token Remote Address** for:

- Registering with the home contract
- Adding collateral
- Debugging issues

</Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens During Deployment

When you deploy NativeTokenRemote:

1. **Precompile Check**: Contract verifies Native Minter is available
2. **Configuration Stored**: Home reference and settings are saved
3. **Initial State**: Contract starts in "not collateralized" state
4. **Ready for Registration**: Can now register with home

## Contract State After Deployment

| State | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Token Home Reference | ✅ Set |
| Registered with Home | ❌ No (next step) |
| Collateralized | ❌ No (requires collateral) |
| Can Mint Tokens | ❌ No (needs collateral) |

## Important Notes

### Precompile Authorization

The NativeTokenRemote contract needs authorization to call the Native Minter precompile. This is typically handled by:

1. Adding the contract address to the precompile's allowlist
2. Or deploying with an account that has minter permissions

### Token Symbol

The bridged native token will use the symbol from the source chain's wrapped token (e.g., "WAVAX" becomes the native token symbol).

## Next Steps

With NativeTokenRemote deployed:

1. **Register with Home**: Establish the bridge connection
2. **Add Collateral**: Enable minting by fully collateralizing
3. **Bridge Tokens**: Start transferring native tokens
