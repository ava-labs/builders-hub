### Transfer the Token Cross-chain

Now that all the bridge contracts have been deployed and registered, you can transfer tokens between chains using our toolbox:

<Callout>
Make sure you have:
1. Deployed your ERC-20 token (from [Deploy ERC-20 Token](/academy/interchain-token-transfer/06-erc-20-to-erc-20-bridge/02-deploy-erc-20-token))
2. Deployed your ERC20Home contract (from [Deploy Home](/academy/interchain-token-transfer/06-erc-20-to-erc-20-bridge/03-deploy-home))
3. Deployed your ERC20TokenRemote contract (from [Deploy Remote](/academy/interchain-token-transfer/06-erc-20-to-erc-20-bridge/04-deploy-remote))
4. Registered your remote bridge with the home bridge (from [Register Remote](/academy/interchain-token-transfer/06-erc-20-to-erc-20-bridge/05-register-remote))
5. Have enough test AVAX for gas fees

### Verify the Transfer

After initiating the transfer, you can verify it was successful by:

1. Checking the transaction status in the toolbox
2. Checking the transaction status in Core Wallet
3. Viewing the transaction details on the [Fuji Explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io)
4. Checking your token balance in Core Wallet on the destination chain

The transfer process may take a few moments to complete as it involves cross-chain communication. You can track the progress through the transaction hash.
