Since the **ERC20 Bridge** course already covers ERC20↔ERC20, in this course we will cover the two native-token bridge patterns:

- **Native token → ERC-20 token**: receive the bridged asset as an ERC-20 on the destination chain
- **Native token → native token**: receive the bridged asset as the destination chain’s **native gas token**

By the end, you’ll be able to deploy the required contracts, register remotes, collateralize when needed, and **test transfers using the console Token Transfer tool**.

Native tokens are the backbone of any blockchain—they're used for gas fees, staking, and protocol operations. However, moving native tokens between chains presents unique challenges since native tokens aren't standard ERC-20 tokens.

Avalanche's **Interchain Token Transfer (ICTT)** protocol solves this by providing a standardized way to bridge native tokens between Avalanche L1s. Think of it as a standardized implementation of a bridge, specifically for transfering tokens, built using Avalanche's ICM technology. The same way ERC20's is a standard implementation for a fungible token on a blockchain, but you can add more functionality in the smart contract, ICTT can be modified for additional requirements. 

### Prerequisites

Before starting this course, we recommend completing:

- [ERC20 Bridge](/academy/avalanche-l1/erc20-bridge) - ICTT mental model (TokenHome/TokenRemote), registration, and transfer basics
- [L1 Native Tokenomics](/academy/avalanche-l1/l1-native-tokenomics) - Native vs ERC-20, wrapped tokens, and token decimals
- [Interchain Messaging](/academy/avalanche-l1/interchain-messaging) - Cross-chain messaging and running a relayer

<Callout>
This course focuses on using the existing testnet chains (Fuji C-Chain, Echo, and Dispatch). For the **Native → Native** flow, we will also spin up a **deployed L1** (BuilderHub hosted) with **Native Minter** enabled.

Since Interchain Token Transfer relies on Interchain Messaging (ICM), you need a relayer running between the chains you’re bridging. Follow the [Running a Relayer](/academy/avalanche-l1/interchain-messaging/09-running-a-relayer/01-relayer-introduction) course to set one up (especially if you’re bridging to a deployed L1).

### Key Concepts (what the console assumes you know)

- **Wrapped native tokens**: native tokens are *not* ERC-20. ICTT’s native-token flows rely on a wrapped native token (e.g., WAVAX) as the ERC-20 representation used by contracts.
- **Testing transfers**: after setup, use the console **Token Transfer** tool to send test transfers and verify balances/receipts end-to-end.
- **Decimal scaling**: if the token representation changes decimals between chains, ICTT uses a multiplier so value is preserved. You usually don’t configure this manually, but you should recognize it when validating amounts.

### What You'll Learn

This course will walk you through:

- **Native → ERC-20 bridge**: Deploy `NativeTokenHome` + `ERC20TokenRemote`, register the remote, then test transfers
- **Native → native bridge**: Deploy `NativeTokenRemote`, register it, **add collateral**, then test transfers (destination tokens become gas tokens)

### Let's Get Started!

Each section builds upon the last, so we recommend completing the course in order.
