## Overview

HTTPayer is a programmable payments layer that helps developers monetize APIs and enable autonomous, machine-to-machine payments using **HTTP 402 Payment Required** and the **x402 Protocol**. Built for Avalanche C-Chain, it supports fast settlement and predictable execution for payment-gated requests and agentic workflows.

## Features

- **HTTP 402 and x402-native payments**: Enable payment-gated API access using HTTP 402 Payment Required and the x402 Protocol.
- **Programmable payment rules**: Define pricing, limits, and policies for automated consumption by apps and agents.
- **USDC-friendly settlement**: Designed for stablecoin-based payment experiences.
- **Avalanche C-Chain support**: Build and test with Avalanche’s high-throughput EVM environment.
- **Developer-first integration**: Provide clean integration paths for backends, gateways, and agent runtimes.

## Documentation

For integration guides and API references, visit the [HTTPayer Documentation](https://docs.httpayer.com/).

## Use Cases

HTTPayer supports multiple Avalanche-native use cases:

- **Paid APIs**: Charge per request, per bundle, or per plan for API products.
- **Agentic commerce**: Allow AI agents to pay for tools, data, and services autonomously.
- **Metered infrastructure**: Monetize compute, storage, or specialized services via pay-per-use.
- **Developer platforms**: Add a programmable payment layer to SDKs, marketplaces, and developer tools.

## Conclusion

HTTPayer provides a practical path to **programmable payments using HTTP 402 and the x402 Protocol** on Avalanche C-Chain, enabling developers to monetize services and support autonomous payment flows for modern apps and agents.
