## Native Token Bridge

This course focuses **only** on the flows exposed in the Builder Console **ICTT setup** tools. Since the **ERC20 Bridge** course already covers ERC20↔ERC20, here we cover the two remaining native-token bridge patterns:

- **Native token → ERC-20 token**: receive the bridged asset as an ERC-20 on the destination chain
- **Native token → native token**: receive the bridged asset as the destination chain’s **native gas token**

By the end, you’ll be able to deploy the required contracts, register remotes, collateralize when needed, and **test transfers using the console Token Transfer tool**.

Native tokens are the backbone of any blockchain—they're used for gas fees, staking, and protocol operations. However, moving native tokens between chains presents unique challenges since native tokens aren't standard ERC-20 tokens.

Avalanche's **Interchain Token Transfer (ICTT)** protocol solves this by providing a standardized way to bridge native tokens between Avalanche L1s.

### Prerequisites

Before starting this course, we recommend completing:

- [ERC20 Bridge](/academy/avalanche-l1/erc20-bridge) - ICTT mental model (TokenHome/TokenRemote), registration, and transfer basics
- [L1 Native Tokenomics](/academy/avalanche-l1/l1-native-tokenomics) - Native vs ERC-20, wrapped tokens, and token decimals
- [Interchain Messaging](/academy/avalanche-l1/interchain-messaging) - Cross-chain messaging and running a relayer

<Callout>
This course focuses on using the existing testnet chains (Fuji C-Chain, Echo, and Dispatch). If you want to create your own L1 blockchain, please refer to the [Creating an L1](/academy/avalanche-l1/avalanche-fundamentals/04-creating-an-l1/01-creating-an-l1) course.
</Callout>

Since Interchain Token Transfer relies on Interchain Messaging (ICM), you must run your own relayer to enable cross-chain communication. Follow the [Running a Relayer](/academy/avalanche-l1/interchain-messaging/09-running-a-relayer/01-relayer-introduction) course to set up your relayer.

### Key Concepts (what the console assumes you know)

- **Wrapped native tokens**: native tokens are *not* ERC-20. ICTT’s native-token flows rely on a wrapped native token (e.g., WAVAX) as the ERC-20 representation used by contracts.
- **Testing transfers**: after setup, use the console **Token Transfer** tool to send test transfers and verify balances/receipts end-to-end.
- **Decimal scaling**: if the token representation changes decimals between chains, ICTT uses a multiplier so value is preserved. You usually don’t configure this manually, but you should recognize it when validating amounts.

### What You'll Learn

This course will walk you through:

- **Native → ERC-20 bridge**: Deploy `NativeTokenHome` + `ERC20TokenRemote`, register the remote, then test transfers
- **Native → native bridge**: Deploy `NativeTokenRemote`, register it, **add collateral**, then test transfers (destination tokens become gas tokens)

### Let's Get Started!

Each section builds upon the last, so we recommend completing the course in order.
