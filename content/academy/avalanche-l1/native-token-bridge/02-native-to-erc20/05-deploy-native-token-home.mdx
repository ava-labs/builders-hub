# Deploy NativeTokenHome

The `NativeTokenHome` contract is deployed on **your L1**. It locks your wrapped native token (WTEST) when users bridge to C-Chain.

## Understanding NativeTokenHome

The NativeTokenHome contract:

- **Wraps and locks** native tokens when users bridge out
- **Releases** native tokens when users bridge back
- **Uses your wrapped token** (WTEST) as the ERC-20 representation
- **Manages remote contract registrations** for security

<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect to Your L1

Ensure your wallet is connected to your L1 where your native token lives.

</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy NativeTokenHome

Use the Deploy Token Home tool below:

1. Select **"Native Token"** as the Transferrer Type
2. Enter your **Wrapped Token Address** (WTEST) from the previous step
3. Confirm the **Teleporter Registry** address is set

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Connected to your L1
2. Deployed your wrapped token (WTEST)
3. Native tokens (TEST) for gas fees
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
    <DeployTokenHome />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Save the Contract Address

After deployment, save the **Token Home Address**. You'll need it when deploying ERC20TokenRemote on C-Chain.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Contract State After Deployment

After deployment, your NativeTokenHome:

- ✅ Is linked to your wrapped token (WTEST)
- ✅ Is connected to the Teleporter Registry for ICM
- ✅ Is ready to accept remote contract registrations
- ❌ Has no remote contracts registered yet

## Next Steps

Now deploy `ERC20TokenRemote` on C-Chain to complete the bridge setup.
