## Overview

So far, you enabled **Transaction AllowList** and **Contract Deployer AllowList** in genesis. In a real network, you won’t always get the genesis config “perfect” on day one, and you may need to **turn precompiles on/off** (or change their parameters) later.

Subnet-EVM supports doing this via **network upgrades** using an `upgrade.json` file. In this section, you’ll **disable** both allowlist precompiles by updating your **Docker validator node** configuration, restarting the node, and then verifying (in the Builder Console) that the precompiles are no longer available.

## Important warning (read this)

- Network upgrades **change the rules** for how blocks are processed. If validators don’t upgrade consistently, the chain can halt or validators can fall out of sync.
- The upgrade file uses **timestamps**. If you set a timestamp in the past (relative to the chain head), the node can fail on startup.

You’ll follow the official guide here:

- `/docs/avalanche-l1s/upgrade/precompile-upgrades`

## Summary

Key points:
- Precompile enable/disable is done via `{chain-config-dir}/{blockchainID}/upgrade.json`.
- Disabling a precompile prevents calls and **clears its storage**, so it can be re-enabled later with fresh config.
- Timestamps must be **in the future**, and upgrade lists should be treated as **append-only**.
