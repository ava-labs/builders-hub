The Staking Manager needs permission to mint native tokens for distributing staking rewards.

## Why Enable Native Minter?

The `NativeTokenStakingManager` distributes rewards by minting new native tokens through the Native Minter precompile. To do this, the Staking Manager's address must be added as an **Enabled** address on the Native Minter.

## Add the NativeTokenStakingManager to Native Minter's Allowlist

<Callout type="warning">
Only addresses with **Manager** or **Admin** permissions on the Native Minter can enable other addresses.
</Callout>
