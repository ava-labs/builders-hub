## Get Free Testnet Tokens

With a Builder Hub account and connected wallet, you'll **automatically receive testnet tokens** on C-Chain, P-Chain, Dispatch, Echo, and other supported L1s. No coupon codes needed!

**How it works:**
1. Create a Builder Hub account (if you haven't already)
2. Connect your Core wallet
3. Tokens are automatically sent to your wallet when needed

### Alternative Faucet

If you prefer not to create a [Builder Hub account](https://build.avax.network/login), you can also use the external [Avalanche Testnet Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?token=c) with coupon code: **avalanche-academy**

### Understanding Wallet Addresses

Your Core wallet shows different addresses for different chains:

- **C-Chain address** (starts with `0x`): Use this for EVM-compatible chains and most Academy tutorials
- **X/P-Chain address** (starts with `fuji` on testnet or `avax` on mainnet): Use this for X-Chain and P-Chain transactions

When requesting tokens from faucets, use the **C-Chain address (0x...)** unless specifically instructed otherwise.

### Troubleshooting

If you experience any issues claiming testnet tokens (such as insufficient faucet balance), please reach out in the <a href="https://t.me/avalancheacademy" target='_blank'>Avalanche Academy Telegram Chat</a>, so our Developer Relations team can assist you and refill the faucet if needed.
