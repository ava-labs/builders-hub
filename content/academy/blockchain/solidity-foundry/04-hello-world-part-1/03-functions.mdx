In this section, we will look at functions. Recall from the beginning of this course that all smart contracts consist of a state and their behaviors. With regards to the latter, functions allow us to define the behavior of a smart contract. 
## Structure of a Function
Similar to other programming languages, all functions consist of two sections: their header and their body. An example of the following can be found below:

```solidity
function getOne() public pure returns(uint) {
    return 1; 
}
```
In the above, we have the code `function getOne() public pure returns(uint)` as the **header** of the function, while the code `return 1;` is the **body** of the function (the body of a function is always encapsulated by curly brackets). 

## Function Header
Focusing first on the header of a function, below is the required syntax that all function must have:

```solidity
function <function_name>(<args>) <visibility>
```

In the parentheses, we list the parameters of the function. In addition to having a name, each parameter of a function must also be marked with its type. The only concept that might be new for most developers is the visibility of a function. In Solidity, we can mark a function with the following visibility traits (we'll understand their descriptions):

- **Public**: Accessible both externally (by other contracts or transactions) and internally (from other functions in the same contract).
- **Private**: Accessible only within the contract where they are defined. Not accessible to derived contracts (we'll learn more about them further on) or externally.
- **Internal**: Accessible within the contract and by derived contracts. Not accessible externally.
- **External**: Accessible only from other contracts and transactions. Cannot be called internally using a direct function call (e.g., `f()`), but can be called using `this.f()` which performs an external call.

Additionally, functions can specify their return type(s) using the `returns` keyword followed by the type(s) in parentheses. For example, `returns(uint)` indicates the function returns a single unsigned integer. When multiple return types are specified, such as `returns(uint, bool)`, the function returns a tuple (a fixed-size collection of elements) containing those values.

## Function Body
As of right now, the only thing we know what to do inside the body of a function is declaring/defining local variables. Inside the bodies of functions, we can also use regular mathematical operations like in other programming languages; the following code demonstrates this:

```solidity
function getSquare(uint num) public returns(uint) {
    uint square = num ** 2;
    return square;
}
```
