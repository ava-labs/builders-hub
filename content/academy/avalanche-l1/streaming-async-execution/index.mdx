## Why Take This Course?

**Streaming Asynchronous Execution (SAE)** represents a fundamental architectural advancement in how Avalanche processes transactions. Defined by [ACP-194](/docs/acps/194-streaming-asynchronous-execution), SAE decouples consensus from execution by introducing a transaction queue upon which consensus is performed. A concurrent execution stream clears the queue and reports a delayed state root for recording by later rounds of consensus.

This course provides a comprehensive understanding of SAE, preparing you for the upcoming changes to Avalanche's execution model.

<Callout type="info" title="ACP Status">
ACP-194 is currently in **Proposed** status with active community discussion. This course teaches the concepts and architecture to prepare developers for when SAE is activated.
