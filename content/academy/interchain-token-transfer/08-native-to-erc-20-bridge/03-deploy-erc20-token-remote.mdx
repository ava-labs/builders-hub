### Deploy ERC20TokenRemote

Use our toolbox to deploy the ERC20TokenRemote contract:

<Callout>
Make sure you have:
1. Connected your Core Wallet to the Fuji testnet
2. Have enough test ECH for gas fees
3. Select the NativeTokenHome contract you deployed in the previous step from the suggestions
4. If you don't see your NativeTokenHome contract in the suggestions, you'll need to manually enter its address
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={173750}>
    <DeployERC20TokenRemote />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

### Save the ERC20 Token Remote Address

After deployment, you'll need to save the contract address for future steps. You can find it in the deployment confirmation in the toolbox.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
Keep this address handy as you'll need it for the next steps in the bridging process.
