## The Deployment That Changes Everything

The Binary Holdings (TBH) has deployed its native blockchain, The Binary Network, as an Avalanche L1, instantly bringing **169 million+ users** into the Avalanche ecosystem. This isn't some theoretical mass adoption. It's already happening now, all powered by Avalanche's L1 architecture.

## Why Build an Avalanche L1?

### Sovereign Blockchain Architecture

Avalanche L1s are independent, sovereign blockchains that operate with their own rules, virtual machines, and tokenomics while leveraging Avalanche's proven infrastructure.

For Binary Holdings, this means:
- **Custom EVM optimizations** for telco-scale operations
- **Native **$BNRY** tokenomics** without external dependencies
- **Direct validator participation** from partners
- **Built-in compliance** through pre-KYC'd users by telco partners

### Performance Metrics That Matter

- 169M+ accessible users (Indonesia & Philippines telcos)
- Currently in early stages with an airdrop campaign to drive more users
- 100+ redemptions already completed

## Technical Implementation

### Core Architecture

**OneWave PWA Integration**: OneWave is Binary Holdings' Progressive Web App (PWA) which functions as a Web3 dApp store embedded directly within telco applications. Users earn **$BNRY** tokens by engaging with dApps, which can be redeemed for phone bills, internet packages, or eCommerce goods.

The tokens flow directly to users' [Enkrypted Wallets](https://enkrypted.io/auth) - our proprietary crypto wallet solution.

The system embeds Web3 directly into existing telco apps through:
- iFrame-based dApp integration
- JWT token swaps for cross-chain interactions
- Chain-agnostic partnerships (we forge partnerships with dApps on any chain)
- Real-time **$BNRY** distribution controlled by our product team

### Security

Integration with FailSafe firewall provides security features, while partnership with Zeeve enabled the migration from our previous infrastructure to an Avalanche L1.

### Interchain Messaging (ICM)

ICM enables native cross-chain communication, allowing Binary Network to connect with 70+ other Avalanche L1s and maintain ecosystem-wide interoperability for future expansion.

## Check Out Our Numbers

### Current State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Accessible Users** | 169M+ (Indonesia, Philippines telcos) |
| **Daily Transactions** | Millions (and growing) |
| **Redemptions** | 100+ completed |
| **dApp Partners** | Multiple chains |
| **Activity** | Airdropping **$BNRY** to drive traffic to OneWave |

### Vision & Growth

- **Our 2025 Target**: Onboard 1 billion telco users globally
- **Token Evolution**: Make **$BNRY** transferable for cross-border remittances, pooling loyalty points, and off-ramping fiat
- **Ecosystem Support**: 15,000 USD worth of [**$BNRY** credits](https://binaryavalanchegrants.notion.site/The-Binary-Holdings-x-Avalanche-Credit-Program-26b0b1ea9fae8025ae51ec2023f6addd) for qualifying dApps to advertise in OneWave

### Boosting the Avalanche Developer Ecosystem

Binary Holdings strengthens Avalanche through:

- **169M+ user distribution** network access for dApps via OneWave
- **15,000 USD worth of **$BNRY** credits** for qualifying projects. Can be used to advertise in prime spots within OneWave and boost traffic
- **dApp integration via iFrames**
- **Open partnership model** accepting any blockchain for integration. Engagement with dApps that live on other chains, is reflected on their native chain.

## Mass Adoption with Avalanche

Binary Holdings' L1 deployment proves that blockchain mass adoption requires Web3 to meet users where they are. 

With more than 169 million users accessible today through our partnerships with the largest telcos in Indonesia and Philippines, Binary Network is not theorizing about adoption. *We are executing it, one transaction at a time*.
