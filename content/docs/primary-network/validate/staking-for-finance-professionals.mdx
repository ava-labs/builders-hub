# Staking for Finance Professionals

A comprehensive guide to Avalanche staking designed for finance professionals, asset managers, accountants, and legal teams who need to understand the mechanics, risks, and operational considerations of staking without deep technical knowledge.

## Executive Summary

Staking on Avalanche allows token holders to earn rewards by participating in network security. Unlike traditional investments, staked tokens remain under your custody but are time-locked for a predetermined period (2 weeks to 1 year). At the end of the staking period, your original principal is returned along with earned rewards.

**Critical for risk assessment: Avalanche does NOT have slashing.** Your staked principal is never at risk of being taken by the protocol or validators, regardless of validator performance. The worst-case scenario is earning zero rewards, not losing your principal.

For organizations holding AVAX, staking provides:
- Predictable yield (5-11% APY range) with no principal risk
- Self-custody throughout the staking period
- Transparent fee structures locked at delegation time
- Clear tax treatment under IRS Revenue Ruling 2023-14

## Validator vs. Delegator: A Business Comparison

Most finance professionals will participate as **delegators** rather than validators. Here's how they compare:

| Aspect | Validator | Delegator |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Role** | Network infrastructure operator | Passive staking participant |
| **Transaction Type** | [`AddValidatorTx`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/master/vms/platformvm/txs/add_validator_tx.go) | [`AddDelegatorTx`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/master/vms/platformvm/txs/add_delegator_tx.go) |
| **Minimum Capital** | 2,000 AVAX (~$60,000-80,000) | 25 AVAX (~$750-1,000) |
| **Hardware Required** | Yes (8-core CPU, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) | No hardware required |
| **Technical Knowledge** | High (Linux, networking, DevOps) | None required |
| **Operational Burden** | 24/7 monitoring and maintenance | Zero operational burden |
| **Risk Profile** | Operational and reputational risk | Minimal (validator selection risk only) |
| **Revenue Stream** | Delegation fees + own rewards | Staking rewards minus delegation fee |
| **Uptime Requirement** | Must maintain >80% uptime | N/A (validator's responsibility) |
| **Liquidity** | Locked during stake period | Locked during stake period |

**Recommendation:** Unless your organization has dedicated infrastructure and technical resources, delegating is the appropriate choice.

## Complete Staking Lifecycle: Step-by-Step

This section provides a detailed breakdown of every step in the staking process, including asset movement, address ownership, and the functional mechanics at each stage. This level of detail is designed to support legal review, accounting requirements, and compliance documentation.

<Callout type="info" title="Key Takeaway: Non-Custodial Design">
At every stage, **you retain ownership of your private keys**. The validator never has access to your funds. The time-lock is enforced by the Avalanche protocol, not by any third party.
</Callout>

---

### Stage 1: Pre-Staking Setup

**What happens:** You hold AVAX in a wallet and prepare to delegate.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Asset Location** | AVAX tokens reside in your P-Chain wallet address |
| **Ownership** | You hold the private keys; you have full control |
| **Liquidity** | Fully liquid - can transfer, sell, or move at any time |
| **On-Chain State** | Tokens appear as unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) in your address |

**Addresses You Need to Set Up:**

| Address Type | Purpose | Who Controls It |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Staking Address (P-Chain)** | Source of funds to be staked | You (required) |
| **Reward Address (P-Chain)** | Where rewards will be sent after staking ends | You (can be same as staking address or different) |

<Callout type="info" title="P-Chain vs. C-Chain">
Staking occurs on the **P-Chain** (Platform Chain), not the C-Chain. If your AVAX is on the C-Chain (used for DeFi/smart contracts), you must first transfer it to the P-Chain. See the "Cross-Chain Transfer" section below for the exact process and transaction types.
</Callout>

#### Cross-Chain Transfer: C-Chain → P-Chain

If your AVAX is on the C-Chain (common for exchange withdrawals and DeFi), you must transfer it to the P-Chain before staking. This is a **two-step atomic transfer** using Avalanche's [Shared Memory](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/master/vms/platformvm/txs/export_tx.go) mechanism:

| Step | Transaction Type | Chain | What It Does |
|------|------------------|-------|--------------|
| **1. Export** | `ExportTx` | C-Chain | Creates a UTXO in shared memory; locks tokens on C-Chain |
| **2. Import** | `ImportTx` | P-Chain | Consumes UTXO from shared memory; creates tokens on P-Chain |

**Transaction Details:**

```
Step 1: ExportTx (on C-Chain)
├── DestinationChain: P-Chain ID
├── ExportedOutputs: Your AVAX amount
└── Result: Tokens locked on C-Chain, UTXO created in shared memory

Step 2: ImportTx (on P-Chain)
├── SourceChain: C-Chain ID
├── ImportedInputs: UTXO reference from shared memory
└── Result: Tokens available on P-Chain for staking
```

**Fees:** Each transaction costs approximately 0.001 AVAX. Total transfer cost: ~0.002 AVAX.

**Wallets Supporting Cross-Chain:** [Core Wallet](https://core.app/), [Avalanche Wallet](https://wallet.avax.network/), and most Avalanche-compatible wallets provide a single "Cross-Chain Transfer" button that executes both transactions automatically.

<Callout type="info" title="Technical Reference">
Transaction type definitions are available in the [AvalancheGo repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/tree/master/vms/platformvm/txs):
- [`export_tx.go`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/master/vms/platformvm/txs/export_tx.go)
- [`import_tx.go`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/master/vms/platformvm/txs/import_tx.go)
</Callout>

**Pre-Staking Decisions:**

| Decision | Options | Cannot Change After Delegation |
|----------|---------|-------------------------------|
| Amount to stake | Minimum 25 AVAX, any amount above | ✓ Locked |
| Staking duration | 2 weeks to 1 year | ✓ Locked |
| Validator selection | Any active validator with capacity | ✓ Locked |
| Reward address | Any P-Chain address you control | ✓ Locked |

---

### Stage 2: Delegation Transaction

**What happens:** You submit an [`AddDelegatorTx`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/master/vms/platformvm/txs/add_delegator_tx.go) transaction to the P-Chain that creates a delegation relationship between your stake and a validator.

**Transaction Type:** `AddDelegatorTx` (Type ID: `0x0000000e`)

**Transaction Parameters:**

| Parameter | What You Specify | AvalancheGo Field | Example |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Node ID** | The unique identifier of the validator you're delegating to | `Validator.NodeID` | `NodeID-A1B2C3D4E5F6...` |
| **Stake Amount** | Amount of AVAX to delegate (min 25 AVAX) | `Validator.Weight` | `1,000 AVAX` |
| **Start Time** | When staking begins (Unix timestamp) | `Validator.StartTime` | `2026-02-01 00:00:00 UTC` |
| **End Time** | When staking ends (Unix timestamp) | `Validator.EndTime` | `2026-08-01 00:00:00 UTC` |
| **Stake Return Address** | Where original stake returns | `StakeOuts` | Your P-Chain address |
| **Reward Address** | P-Chain address to receive rewards | `DelegationRewardsOwner` | `P-avax1abc123...` |

**What the Transaction Does:**

1. **Validates parameters:** Protocol checks that:
   - Amount meets minimum (25 AVAX)
   - Duration is within 2 weeks to 1 year
   - Validator exists and has delegation capacity
   - Your delegation end time ≤ validator's stake end time
   - Delegation fee rate is captured (from validator's current setting)

2. **Creates time-lock:** Protocol creates a UTXO that:
   - Contains your staked AVAX
   - Is spendable ONLY after the specified end time
   - References the validator's Node ID
   - Cannot be modified, transferred, or canceled

3. **Updates validator weight:** Your stake is added to the validator's total stake weight (used in consensus calculations)

**Transaction Fee:** Approximately 0.001 AVAX (negligible)

**Resulting On-Chain State:**

| After Transaction | State |
|-------------------|-------|
| Your staking address | Balance decreased by stake amount |
| Time-locked UTXO | Created with your stake, locked until end time |
| Validator's delegation list | Your delegation added |
| Validator's total weight | Increased by your stake amount |

<Callout type="warn" title="Irreversible Transaction">
Once the delegation transaction is confirmed on the P-Chain, the following CANNOT be changed:
- Stake amount
- Start/end times
- Validator selection
- Reward address

There is NO mechanism for early withdrawal. Plan your liquidity needs accordingly.
</Callout>

---

### Stage 3: Active Staking Period

**What happens:** Your AVAX is time-locked and contributes to the validator's stake weight. The validator uses this combined weight to participate in consensus.

**Duration:** Minimum 2 weeks, maximum 1 year (as specified in your delegation transaction)

**Asset Status During Staking:**

| Aspect | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Location** | Time-locked UTXO on P-Chain | Still at an address derived from your keys |
| **Ownership** | You | You retain private keys; validator has NO access |
| **Control** | Protocol-enforced time-lock | Neither you NOR validator can move these funds |
| **Visibility** | Publicly visible on blockchain | Anyone can verify your delegation via block explorer |
| **Balance Sheet** | Your asset | Should remain on your books as a time-locked intangible asset |

**What the Validator Does (and Does NOT Do):**

| Validator Actions | What This Means for You |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| ✓ Validates transactions on the network | Your stake weight contributes to network security |
| ✓ Proposes blocks when selected | Selection probability proportional to total stake (including delegations) |
| ✓ Maintains node uptime | Affects whether you earn rewards (>80% required) |
| ✗ Cannot access your funds | Non-custodial - they have no keys to your AVAX |
| ✗ Cannot change delegation fee | Fee locked at time of your delegation |
| ✗ Cannot end your delegation early | Time-lock is protocol-enforced |
| ✗ Cannot redirect your rewards | Rewards go to address YOU specified |

**Reward Accrual:**

Rewards are NOT distributed incrementally during the staking period. Instead:
- Protocol calculates potential rewards based on stake amount and duration
- Actual reward is determined ONLY at the end of the period
- Reward depends on validator meeting 80% uptime threshold
- No "accrued but not yet received" rewards to account for during the period

**Monitoring During Staking:**

| What to Monitor | How | Why |
|-----------------|-----|-----|
| Validator uptime | [Validator Health Dashboard](https://stats.avax.network/dashboard/validator-health-check/) | Below 80% uptime = zero rewards |
| Delegation status | Block explorer (search your Node ID) | Confirm delegation is active |
| Time remaining | Calendar/reminder | Plan for funds returning |

---

### Stage 4: End of Staking Period and Distribution

**What happens:** The staking period ends automatically at the specified end time. The protocol calculates rewards and distributes funds via a [`RewardValidatorTx`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/master/vms/platformvm/txs/reward_validator_tx.go) transaction.

**Reward Transaction Type:** `RewardValidatorTx`

This transaction is automatically issued by a block proposer when your staking period ends. You do not need to submit anything.

**Automatic Process (No Action Required):**

The P-Chain automatically executes the following at your delegation end time:

**Step 4.1: Uptime Determination**

| Validator Uptime | Result |
|------------------|--------|
| **≥ 80%** | Rewards calculated and distributed |
| **Below 80%** | No rewards (principal still returned) |

The 80% threshold is determined by weighted sampling of other validators throughout the staking period. This is an on-chain consensus mechanism, not a single point of measurement.

**Step 4.2: Reward Calculation (if uptime ≥ 80%)**

The protocol calculates your gross reward based on:
- Your stake amount
- Staking duration
- Network parameters at time of staking
- Total network supply vs. maximum supply (720M cap)

**Step 4.3: Fee Deduction**

| Component | Amount | Destination |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Gross Reward** | Calculated by protocol | — |
| **Minus Delegation Fee** | Gross reward × fee rate (e.g., 2%) | Validator's reward address |
| **Equals Net Reward** | Gross reward - fee | Your reward address |

**Example Calculation:**

```
Stake Amount:        1,000 AVAX
Staking Duration:    6 months
Delegation Fee:      2%
Validator Uptime:    98% (meets threshold)

Gross Reward:        ~35 AVAX (example rate)
Delegation Fee:      35 × 2% = 0.7 AVAX (to validator)
Net Reward:          35 - 0.7 = 34.3 AVAX (to you)
```

**Step 4.4: Fund Distribution**

| Distribution | Amount | Destination Address | When |
|--------------|--------|--------------------|----|
| **Original Stake** | Full amount staked | Your original staking address | Immediately at period end |
| **Net Rewards** | Gross rewards minus fee | Your designated reward address | Immediately at period end |
| **Validator Fee** | Fee portion of your rewards | Validator's address | Batched at validator's period end |

<Callout type="info" title="Reward Timing">
Your principal and net rewards are returned immediately when YOUR delegation period ends. You do not need to wait for the validator's staking period to end. However, the validator receives their fee portion only when their own validation period ends (fees are batched).
</Callout>

**Final On-Chain State:**

| After Distribution | State |
|--------------------|-------|
| Time-locked UTXO | Consumed/spent |
| Your staking address | Balance increased by original stake |
| Your reward address | Balance increased by net rewards |
| Validator's pending fees | Increased (distributed when their period ends) |

---

### Stage 5: Post-Staking

**What happens:** Funds have been returned. You have full control and liquidity.

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Original Stake** | Returned to staking address, fully liquid |
| **Rewards** | Received at reward address, fully liquid |
| **Delegation Status** | Ended; no longer contributing to validator |
| **Options** | Re-delegate, transfer, hold, or sell |

**Post-Staking Actions:**

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Re-delegate** | Stake again to same or different validator (starts new period) |
| **Transfer to C-Chain** | Move AVAX to C-Chain for DeFi or smart contracts |
| **Hold** | Keep AVAX in P-Chain wallet (not earning rewards) |
| **Transfer out** | Send to exchange or other wallet |

---

### Summary: Address and Fund Flow

| Stage | Your P-Chain Staking Address | Your P-Chain Reward Address | Validator |
|-------|------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| **1. Pre-Staking** | Holds AVAX (liquid) | Empty or existing balance | Not involved |
| **2. Delegation Tx** | Decreases by stake amount | No change | Receives delegation reference |
| **3. Staking Period** | Time-locked UTXO exists (visible, not spendable) | No change | Cannot access your funds |
| **4. Distribution** | Increases by original stake | Increases by net rewards | Receives fee (batched) |
| **5. Post-Staking** | Fully liquid | Fully liquid | Delegation ended |

<Callout type="info" title="Non-Custodial Staking">
At no point do validators or any third party gain custody or control of your delegated funds. The time-lock is enforced by the Avalanche protocol itself. You retain ownership of your private keys and can prove ownership at any time.
</Callout>

---

## Address Ownership and Custody

For compliance and audit purposes, here's exactly who controls what at each stage:

| Stage | Private Key Control | Fund Control | Custody Classification | Can Move Funds? |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Pre-Staking** | You | You | Self-custody | Yes |
| **During Staking** | You | No one (protocol time-locked) | Self-custody (time-locked) | No (until unlock) |
| **Post-Staking** | You | You | Self-custody | Yes |

**Key Points for Legal/Compliance:**
- Private keys never leave your control
- No third-party custodian is involved
- Staked assets remain on your balance sheet
- Time-lock is a protocol-level smart contract, not a custodial agreement
- You can cryptographically prove ownership throughout the staking period

## Staking Parameters: Quick Reference

### Mainnet Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Business Implication |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| **Minimum Validator Stake** | 2,000 AVAX | ~$60,000-80,000 capital requirement |
| **Maximum Validator Stake** | 3,000,000 AVAX | Position size limits |
| **Minimum Delegator Stake** | 25 AVAX | ~$750-1,000 minimum investment |
| **Minimum Stake Duration** | 2 weeks | Shortest lockup period |
| **Maximum Stake Duration** | 1 year | Longest lockup period |
| **Minimum Delegation Fee** | 2% | Lowest possible validator commission |
| **Typical Delegation Fee Range** | 2-10% | Market rates for validator services |
| **Uptime Requirement** | 80% | Threshold for ANY reward (binary) |
| **Slashing** | None | Principal is never at risk |
| **Max Delegation per Validator** | 5x validator's own stake | Concentration limits |

### Reward Expectations

| Staking Duration | Typical APY Range | Notes |
|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **2 weeks (minimum)** | 5-7% | Annualized equivalent |
| **6 months** | 7-9% | Mid-duration |
| **1 year (maximum)** | 9-11% | Highest rewards for longest commitment |

<Callout type="warn" title="Rates Are Not Guaranteed">
These are typical ranges observed on mainnet. Actual rewards depend on:
- Total network staking participation
- Your chosen validator's uptime (must exceed 80%)
- Delegation fee charged by the validator
- Network emission schedule (decreases over time as max supply approaches)
</Callout>

### Duration Considerations

| Duration | Liquidity Trade-off | Recommended For |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **2 weeks - 3 months** | Higher liquidity, lower yield | Treasury management, short-term holding |
| **3-6 months** | Balanced approach | Medium-term positions |
| **6-12 months** | Lower liquidity, higher yield | Long-term strategic holdings |

**Important:** You CANNOT withdraw early. Choose your duration carefully based on liquidity needs.

---

## Risk Assessment

### Avalanche's No-Slashing Policy

<Callout type="info" title="No Slashing on Avalanche">
Avalanche does NOT have slashing. Your staked principal is NEVER at risk of being taken by the protocol, validators, or any other party. This is a fundamental design decision that differentiates Avalanche from proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum.
</Callout>

**What this means:**
- Worst-case scenario: You earn zero rewards if validator uptime is below 80%
- Your original stake is ALWAYS returned in full
- No risk of partial or total principal loss due to validator behavior
- No "insurance" or slashing protection products needed

**Avalanche's philosophy:** Per official documentation: "We believe in building 'calm technology' that is powerful, but predictable. With Avalanche, staked tokens are never at risk of a faulty network crackdown."

### Risk Matrix for Delegators

| Risk Type | Likelihood | Impact on Principal | Impact on Returns | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Loss of Principal** | None | Zero (no slashing) | N/A | N/A - protocol guarantee |
| **Loss of Rewards** | Medium | Zero | High (100% of rewards) | Choose validators with >95% historical uptime |
| **Liquidity Risk** | Certain | Zero | Opportunity cost | Match stake duration to liquidity needs |
| **Validator Fee Higher Than Expected** | None | Zero | None | Fee locked at delegation time, cannot change |
| **Protocol/Smart Contract Risk** | Low | High | High | Inherent to all blockchain protocols |
| **Counterparty Risk** | None | Zero | N/A | Non-custodial design eliminates this risk |
| **Regulatory Risk** | Low-Medium | Zero | Unclear | Consult legal counsel for your jurisdiction |

### Comparison with Traditional Finance

| Traditional Investment | Avalanche Staking |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Bank deposit (principal protected) | ✓ Principal protected (no slashing) |
| Fixed interest rate | ✗ Rewards vary, not guaranteed |
| FDIC insured (US) | ✗ No insurance (blockchain protocol) |
| Can withdraw anytime (demand deposit) | ✗ Time-locked until maturity |
| Custodial (bank holds funds) | ✓ Self-custodial (you hold keys) |
| Yields: 0-5% (2025) | Yields: 5-11% (varies) |

## Tax and Accounting Considerations

<Callout type="warn" title="Tax Disclaimer">
This section provides general information only. Tax treatment varies by jurisdiction and individual circumstances. Always consult with qualified tax and accounting professionals before making staking decisions.
</Callout>

### IRS Guidance for US Taxpayers

The IRS addressed proof-of-stake staking rewards in **Revenue Ruling 2023-14** (July 2023).

| Question | IRS Position | Practical Implication for Avalanche |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| **When are rewards taxable?** | When you gain "dominion and control" | On Avalanche: When rewards are distributed at end of staking period (not during staking) |
| **What is the tax treatment?** | Ordinary income | Not capital gains - taxed at your regular income tax rate |
| **What is the taxable amount?** | Fair market value at time of receipt | Use AVAX price at the moment rewards are distributed |
| **What is the cost basis of received tokens?** | FMV at receipt | For future capital gains/loss calculations when you sell |

### Key Tax Dates

| Event | Tax Implication | What to Record |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Delegation Transaction** | No immediate tax event | Transaction hash, date, amount staked, FMV of AVAX |
| **During Staking Period** | No tax events | N/A (rewards accrue but not yet received) |
| **End of Staking Period** | Ordinary income recognized | Date/time of distribution, gross reward amount, net reward after fees, FMV of AVAX at distribution |
| **Sale of Staked AVAX** | Capital gain/loss | Use original purchase cost basis, not staking start date |
| **Sale of Reward AVAX** | Capital gain/loss | Use FMV at receipt as cost basis |

### International Considerations

Tax treatment varies significantly by jurisdiction:

| Jurisdiction | Typical Treatment | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| **United States** | Ordinary income at receipt | Per IRS Rev. Rul. 2023-14 |
| **European Union** | Varies by member state | Some treat as income, others as capital gains |
| **United Kingdom** | Miscellaneous income | Subject to income tax |
| **Singapore** | Generally not taxable for individuals | For personal long-term investment |
| **Australia** | Ordinary income at receipt | Similar to US treatment |

**Always consult local tax advisors** in your operating jurisdiction.

### Record-Keeping Requirements

Finance teams should maintain comprehensive records:

**At Delegation:**
- Transaction hash of delegation transaction
- Date and timestamp (UTC)
- Amount of AVAX delegated
- Validator Node ID
- Validator delegation fee rate (locked at this time)
- Staking start and end dates
- Fair market value of AVAX at delegation (per share/token)
- P-Chain address used for delegation
- Designated reward address

**At Distribution:**
- Transaction hash of distribution transaction
- Date and timestamp (UTC)
- Gross reward amount (before validator fee)
- Validator fee amount deducted
- Net reward amount received
- Fair market value of AVAX at distribution time
- Exchange rate source used for FMV determination

**Recommended Tools:**
- Block explorer (Snowtrace/AvalancheScan) for transaction verification
- Price data from reputable exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, etc.)
- Crypto tax software (CoinTracker, Koinly, TokenTax) for automated tracking

### Accounting Treatment

**Under US GAAP:**
- Cryptocurrencies are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets
- Subject to impairment testing (not amortization)
- Staked assets should be disclosed separately
- Rewards recognized as income when received

**Under IFRS:**
- Typically classified as intangible assets
- IAS 38 applies
- May be held as inventory if part of business operations
- Rewards recognized when receipt is virtually certain

**Key Accounting Questions:**

**Q: How should staked AVAX appear on the balance sheet?**
A: As intangible assets, potentially with a note disclosure indicating they are time-locked and the unlock date.

**Q: When should rewards be accrued?**
A: Generally at distribution, not during the staking period, unless virtually certain based on validator performance.

**Q: Is the delegation fee deductible?**
A: This is not explicitly addressed in IRS guidance. The fee is automatically deducted from gross rewards by the protocol. Consult your tax advisor on whether this reduces taxable income or is treated as a separate expense.

## Operational Checklists

### Pre-Delegation Checklist

Before delegating AVAX, verify the following:

**Liquidity and Planning:**
- Confirmed you will NOT need these funds for the entire staking period
- Selected appropriate duration based on liquidity needs (2 weeks to 1 year)
- Understood that early withdrawal is IMPOSSIBLE
- Documented planned staking period in treasury management system

**Validator Selection:**
- Researched multiple validators (recommend reviewing 5-10)
- Verified current uptime percentage (target: >95%)
- Checked historical uptime performance (6+ month track record)
- Confirmed validator's delegation fee (lower = more rewards to you)
- Verified validator has available delegation capacity (max 5x their stake)
- Confirmed validator's staking period extends beyond your planned delegation
- Documented validator Node ID and contact information (if available)

**Technical Setup:**
- Confirmed you're using a P-Chain address (not C-Chain or X-Chain)
- Verified you control the private keys for the staking address
- Set appropriate reward address (where rewards will be sent)
- Tested small transaction first if using new wallet software
- Backed up wallet seed phrase in secure location

**Documentation and Compliance:**
- Recorded all parameters for tax/accounting records (see Record-Keeping section)
- Obtained necessary internal approvals per treasury policy
- Documented rationale for validator selection
- Noted Fair Market Value of AVAX at delegation time
- Created calendar reminder for staking period end date

**Risk Acknowledgment:**
- Understood no slashing = principal always returned
- Understood that below 80% uptime = zero rewards (but principal returned)
- Reviewed organization's risk tolerance for crypto yield products
- Documented risk assessment for compliance purposes

### Validator Selection Criteria

Use this framework to evaluate and compare validators:

| Criterion | Weight | Why It Matters | How to Verify | Acceptable Range |
|-----------|--------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Uptime %** | Critical | Must exceed 80% for ANY reward | Validator health dashboard | >95% target, >98% ideal |
| **Delegation Fee** | High | Directly impacts your net returns | Listed on explorer | 2-5% competitive, below 2% excellent |
| **Delegation Capacity** | High | Must have room for your stake | Check current delegations vs max (5x validator stake) | At least 20% capacity remaining |
| **Remaining Stake Period** | Critical | Your delegation must end before theirs | Listed on explorer | Extends at least 2 weeks beyond your planned period |
| **Historical Performance** | Medium | Track record indicates reliability | Review past staking periods | Consistent >95% uptime |
| **Validator Reputation** | Low | Community trust and transparency | Forum discussions, validator website | Established presence preferred |

**Red Flags:**
- Uptime below 90% in recent staking periods
- Delegation fee above 10%
- Validator stake period ends soon (within your delegation timeframe)
- No historical data (brand new validator)
- Capacity nearly full (>95% utilized)

### Post-Staking Checklist

After your staking period ends:

**Verify Distribution:**
- Confirmed original stake returned to your address
- Confirmed rewards received at designated reward address
- Verified reward amount matches expected calculation (accounting for fees)
- Saved transaction hashes for both returns

**Tax and Accounting:**
- Recorded Fair Market Value of AVAX at distribution time
- Calculated gross and net reward amounts
- Documented for tax filing (ordinary income)
- Updated cost basis records for future capital gains calculations
- Provided documentation to accounting team

**Performance Review:**
- Calculated actual APY received
- Compared actual vs expected returns
- Evaluated validator performance (uptime achieved)
- Documented lessons learned for future delegations
- Updated validator selection criteria based on experience

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I lose my principal by staking on Avalanche?

**No.** Avalanche does not have slashing, which means your staked principal is never at risk of being taken by the protocol or validators. The worst-case scenario is earning zero rewards if your chosen validator's uptime falls below 80%. Your full principal amount is always returned at the end of the staking period.

This is a fundamental design decision that differentiates Avalanche from other proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum, where validator misbehavior can result in partial or total loss of staked principal.

### Who has custody of my AVAX during the staking period?

**You do.** Staking on Avalanche is non-custodial. You retain ownership of your private keys throughout the staking period. The validator cannot access, move, or spend your staked tokens.

The time-lock is enforced by the Avalanche protocol's smart contracts, not by the validator. While you cannot move the tokens during the lock period, you maintain cryptographic ownership and can prove ownership at any time.

### When are staking rewards taxable?

**At distribution.** According to IRS Revenue Ruling 2023-14 (for US taxpayers), staking rewards are taxable as ordinary income when you gain "dominion and control" over them. On Avalanche, this occurs at the end of the staking period when rewards are automatically distributed to your designated reward address.

Rewards are NOT taxable during the staking period while they are accruing but not yet received. The taxable amount is the fair market value of the rewards at the moment of distribution.

### Can I withdraw my stake early if I need the funds?

**No.** Early withdrawal is not possible on Avalanche. When you delegate, you commit to a specific time period (minimum 2 weeks, maximum 1 year). The protocol enforces this time-lock, and there is no mechanism for early redemption.

**Planning consideration:** Only stake funds you are certain you will not need for the entire staking period. Match your stake duration to your organization's liquidity needs and treasury management policies.

### What happens if my validator goes offline?

If your validator's uptime falls below 80% during your staking period:
- Your original principal is returned in full (no slashing)
- You receive ZERO rewards (no partial rewards for partial uptime)
- The validator also receives no rewards for that period

The 80% threshold is binary: either the validator meets it and everyone gets rewards, or it doesn't and nobody gets rewards.

**Mitigation:** Choose validators with historical uptime >95% to minimize this risk.

### How do I choose a reliable validator?

Use these selection criteria in order of importance:

1. **Uptime performance:** Historical uptime >95%, ideally >98%
2. **Delegation fee:** Lower fees = more rewards to you (competitive range: 2-5%)
3. **Available capacity:** Validator must have room for your stake (check current delegations)
4. **Stake period alignment:** Validator's period must extend beyond yours
5. **Track record:** Prefer validators with 6+ months of consistent performance

See the "Validator Selection Criteria" table in the Operational Checklists section for a complete framework.

### What is the minimum amount I need to stake?

**For delegators:** 25 AVAX minimum (approximately $750-1,000 at typical prices)

**For validators:** 2,000 AVAX minimum (approximately $60,000-80,000), plus hardware and technical expertise

Most finance professionals will participate as delegators due to the lower capital requirements and zero operational burden.

### Can the validator change their fee after I delegate?

**No.** The delegation fee is locked at the time you submit your delegation transaction and cannot be changed during your staking period. The fee rate you agree to at delegation is the rate that will be applied when rewards are calculated at the end of the period.

### How are delegation fees paid?

Delegation fees are automatically deducted from your gross rewards by the protocol at the end of the staking period. You never need to make a separate payment.

**Example:**
- Gross reward: 10 AVAX
- Validator fee: 2%
- Fee deducted: 0.2 AVAX (goes to validator)
- Net reward to you: 9.8 AVAX

The fee is taken from rewards, not from your principal.

### Is staking AVAX legal in my jurisdiction?

Regulatory treatment varies significantly by jurisdiction. In most countries, staking is considered legal, but the tax treatment and regulatory requirements differ.

**General categories:**
- **United States:** Legal. Rewards taxed as ordinary income per IRS guidance.
- **European Union:** Generally legal, but varies by member state. Some require registration for large-scale operations.
- **United Kingdom:** Legal. Rewards typically treated as miscellaneous income.
- **Asia-Pacific:** Varies widely. Singapore generally favorable, China restrictive.

**Recommendation:** Consult legal counsel familiar with digital assets in your operating jurisdiction before making staking decisions, especially for institutional or corporate staking.

### How do I verify my staking transaction and rewards?

Use Avalanche block explorers to verify all transactions:

**Recommended Explorers:**
- [Snowtrace](https://snowtrace.io/) - P-Chain explorer
- [AvalancheScan](https://avascan.info/) - Multi-chain explorer

**What to verify:**
1. **Delegation transaction:** Search your P-Chain address or transaction hash
2. **Staking status:** View current delegations and their parameters
3. **Reward distribution:** Verify rewards received at the designated address
4. **Validator performance:** Check your validator's historical uptime

All transactions are publicly verifiable on the blockchain, providing a transparent audit trail for compliance and accounting purposes.

## Conclusion

Avalanche staking offers finance professionals a unique opportunity to earn yield on AVAX holdings with predictable risk characteristics:

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Principal is always safe** - Avalanche's no-slashing policy ensures your staked amount is always returned
- **Non-custodial design** - You retain ownership and control of your private keys throughout
- **Clear tax treatment** - IRS has provided explicit guidance (Rev. Rul. 2023-14) for US taxpayers
- **Transparent fees** - Delegation fees are locked at delegation time and cannot change
- **Operational simplicity** - Delegators have zero operational burden (validators handle all infrastructure)

**Before Staking:**
- Match stake duration to your liquidity needs (cannot withdraw early)
- Select validators with high uptime (>95% recommended)
- Document all parameters for tax and accounting compliance
- Consult legal and tax professionals for your specific jurisdiction

Staking on Avalanche is fundamentally different from traditional yield products due to its non-custodial nature, but with proper planning and validator selection, it can be a valuable component of digital asset treasury management.

## Coming Soon: Continuous Staking (ACP-236)

<Callout type="info" title="Proposed - Not Yet Live">
[ACP-236: Continuous Staking](/docs/acps/236-continuous-staking) is currently in **Proposed** status. The features below will require a network upgrade to implement. This section is provided for planning purposes.
</Callout>

### What Is Continuous Staking?

ACP-236 proposes a mechanism allowing validators to remain staked indefinitely without manually resubmitting staking transactions at each period's end. Instead of committing to a fixed end time, validators would specify a **cycle duration** and an **auto-renew policy**.

### Key Changes from Current System

| Aspect | Current System | With ACP-236 |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Staking Duration** | Fixed end time, must re-stake manually | Automatic renewal at cycle end |
| **Reward Handling** | All rewards returned at period end | Configurable: auto-compound or withdraw |
| **Exit Process** | Delegation simply ends | Submit `SetAutoRenewPolicyTx` to signal exit |
| **Transaction Burden** | New transaction every staking period | One transaction, runs indefinitely |
| **Uptime Tracking** | Measured over entire period | Reset each cycle |

### New Transaction Types

ACP-236 introduces three new P-Chain transactions:

| Transaction | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `AddContinuousValidatorTx` | Create a continuous validator with cycle duration and auto-renew policy |
| `SetAutoRenewPolicyTx` | Modify the auto-renew policy or signal exit at cycle end |
| `RewardContinuousValidatorTx` | Issued by block builders to process cycle rewards |

### Auto-Renew Rewards Policy

The `AutoRenewRewardsShares` field (expressed in millionths) controls what happens to rewards at each cycle end:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `0` | Restake principal only; withdraw 100% of rewards |
| `300,000` | Restake 30% of rewards; withdraw 70% |
| `1,000,000` | Restake 100% of rewards (full compounding) |
| `MaxUint64` | Signal to exit at current cycle end |

### Benefits for Finance Professionals

1. **Reduced Operational Burden:** Fewer transactions to sign and manage
2. **Automatic Compounding:** Rewards can auto-restake each cycle
3. **Enhanced Security:** Less frequent key signing reduces exposure risk
4. **Flexible Exit:** Can signal exit mid-cycle; takes effect at cycle end
5. **Simpler Treasury Management:** Set-and-forget staking operations

### Impact on Delegators

<Callout type="warn" title="Delegators: No Continuous Delegation">
ACP-236 applies to **validators only**. Delegators cannot delegate continuously because there is no guarantee a validator will continue beyond their current cycle. Delegation constraints remain unchanged: your delegation period must fit within the validator's current cycle.
</Callout>

### Timeline

ACP-236 is currently in the [discussion phase](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/discussions/244). Implementation requires a network upgrade. Monitor the [ACPs repository](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs) for status updates.
