In the previous section, we learned about precompiles and how they enable protocol-level customization of your L1. Now we'll put that knowledge into practice with the **Native Minter Precompile**â€”one of the most powerful tools for managing your blockchain's tokenomics.

## What You'll Learn

This section covers:
- **Native Token Supply**: Understanding hard-capped vs. flexible token supplies
- **Native Minter Precompile**: How to enable and control native token minting
- **Minting Rights Management**: Configuring who can mint new tokens

## Why This Matters

The Native Minter Precompile determines whether your blockchain has a fixed token supply (like Bitcoin's 21M cap) or can mint additional tokens as needed. This decision has major implications:

- **Valueless Gas Tokens**: Enable gas-free user experiences by minting tokens as needed
- **Controlled Inflation**: Manage token supply for economic incentives
- **Protocol Flexibility**: Adapt your tokenomics as your ecosystem grows

By the end of this section, you'll understand how to configure native token minting rights for your L1's specific use case.

Let's dive in!
