# Deploy ERC20TokenHome

The `ERC20TokenHome` contract is deployed on Fuji C-Chain. It locks USDC when users bridge to your L1 and releases USDC when they bridge back.

## Understanding ERC20TokenHome

The ERC20TokenHome contract:

- **Locks USDC** when users bridge to your L1
- **Releases USDC** when users bridge back from your L1
- **Manages remote contract registrations** for security
- **Communicates via ICM** (Interchain Messaging)

## USDC on Fuji

For this course, we'll use the USDC implementation on Fuji testnet.

<Callout type="info">
**USDC Contract on Fuji**: You can use any ERC-20 token for this exercise. The toolbox will let you enter the token address.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect to Fuji C-Chain

Ensure your wallet is connected to **Fuji C-Chain**. The toolbox will detect the chain and show relevant options.

</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy ERC20TokenHome

Use the Deploy Token Home tool below:

1. Select **"ERC-20 Token"** as the Transferrer Type
2. Enter the **USDC token address** on Fuji
3. Confirm the **Teleporter Registry** address is set

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Connected your Core Wallet to Fuji testnet
2. Sufficient test AVAX for gas fees
3. Selected "ERC-20 Token" as the transferrer type
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <DeployTokenHome />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Save the Contract Address

After deployment, save the **Token Home Address**. You'll need it when deploying the NativeTokenRemote contract on your L1.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Contract State After Deployment

After deployment, your ERC20TokenHome:

- ✅ Is linked to USDC on Fuji
- ✅ Is connected to the Teleporter Registry for ICM
- ✅ Is ready to accept remote contract registrations
- ❌ Has no remote contracts registered yet

## Next Steps

Now deploy `NativeTokenRemote` on your L1 to complete the bridge setup.
