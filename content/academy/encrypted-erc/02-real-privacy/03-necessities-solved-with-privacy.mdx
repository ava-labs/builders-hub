Privacy on Avalanche is not only about hiding information, it’s about **unlocking use cases that would otherwise be impossible** in a fully transparent blockchain environment.  
By combining confidentiality with auditability, privacy-enabled tokens can meet both **business** and **regulatory** requirements.

## 1. Sensitive Transactions

Certain payments and transfers must remain confidential to protect business interests and personal security:
- **Enterprise payments**: Salaries, supplier payments, and investment deals that should not be visible to competitors.
- **Strategic asset moves**: Acquisitions, treasury management, or cross-company settlements.
- **Personal financial data**: Protecting individuals from profiling or targeted attacks based on on-chain activity.

---

## 2. Enterprise Use

Organizations building on Avalanche, whether on **C-Chain** or a dedicated **L1**, may require privacy for:
- **Internal token economies**: Reward points, access tokens, or employee incentives where transaction history should remain private.
- **Corporate NFT strategies**: Membership passes, certifications, or asset ownership records that could reveal strategic information.
- **Supply chain confidentiality**: Tracking goods on-chain without exposing trade volumes and partner relationships.

## 3. Regulated Financial Products

Financial institutions can benefit from privacy without sacrificing compliance:
- **Tokenized securities or bonds**: Keeping investor details and trade sizes private while allowing regulator access.
- **Private lending protocols**: Concealing borrower data while enabling repayment verification.
- **Confidential DeFi**: Yield farming or liquidity provision without revealing exact positions to the public.

## Why Privacy is a Business Enabler

Without privacy, many organizations avoid blockchain entirely due to:
- **Risk of data exposure**: Competitors analyzing public activity to gain market advantage.
- **Regulatory conflicts**: Inability to comply with privacy laws while using transparent ledgers.
- **Security concerns**: Public transaction data can make users targets for scams or hacks.

By enabling **selective transparency** — where only authorized entities can see sensitive details, Avalanche projects can:
- Attract enterprise and institutional adoption.
- Expand into regulated markets.
- Create safer, more competitive ecosystems.

In the **next section**, we will introduce **Encrypted Tokens**, starting with **eERC (Encrypted ERC)** — Avalanche’s privacy-focused token standard that brings **encrypted balances, private transfers, and compliance-ready auditability** to the EVM ecosystem.
