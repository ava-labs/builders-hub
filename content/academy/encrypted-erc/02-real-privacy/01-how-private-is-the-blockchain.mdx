One of the most common misconceptions about blockchain is that it is **private**.  
In reality, on Avalanche, whether you operate on the C-Chain **Mainnet**, **Fuji (Testnet)**, or a custom L1, the blockchain is **transparent by design**. Every transaction is recorded in a public ledger and can be inspected by anyone with the right tools.

## Transparency in Avalanche

- **Every transaction is public**: Transfers, mints, burns, and contract interactions are visible in block explorers like [SnowTrace](https://snowtrace.io).  
- **Balances are public**: Anyone can check the token holdings of any address by querying the blockchain.  
- **Ownership history is public**: For NFTs (ERC-721 and ERC-1155), all past owners are permanently recorded.  

This transparency is valuable for:
- **Auditability**: Anyone can verify that a transaction took place and check the exact amounts.  
- **Trustless systems**: No need for a central authority to confirm balances or transaction histories.  
- **Security monitoring**: Easier to detect suspicious activity or exploits in real time.

## Pseudonymity vs Anonymity

Avalanche, like other EVM-compatible blockchains, is **pseudonymous**, not truly anonymous.  
- **Pseudonymity**: Users are identified by their public address (e.g., `0x1234...abcd`), but not by their real name.  
- **Linkability**: Once an address is tied to an identity (via KYC, exchange deposits, or off-chain information), all past and future activity from that address can be analyzed.  
- **Behavioral profiling**: Patterns in interactions (like dApps used, tokens traded, or NFTs purchased) can reveal insights about the owner.

## Confidentiality Limitations

While transparency is useful for verification, it creates significant limitations for certain use cases:
- **Business transactions**: Competitors can see volumes, counterparties, and frequency of payments.  
- **Personal privacy**: Anyone can track your activity and build a profile of your blockchain behavior.  
- **Regulated industries**: Some sectors require confidentiality for compliance (e.g., healthcare, finance).

## Example on Avalanche C-Chain

If a company pays 50 employees using an ERC-20 token on Avalanche C-Chain:
- The **amount**, **date**, and **recipient address** of each payment will be public.  
- A competitor or third party could track salary patterns, hiring trends, or even link addresses to individuals.

Avalancheâ€™s transparent design ensures trust and auditability, but **it does not provide native confidentiality** for balances, transaction amounts, or metadata.  
In the **next section**, we will explore **Compliance**, why privacy alone is not enough, and how companies must align with regulatory requirements when designing blockchain solutions.
