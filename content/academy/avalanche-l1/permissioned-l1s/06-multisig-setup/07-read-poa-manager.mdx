import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/toolbox/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx";
import ReadPoAManager from "@/components/toolbox/console/permissioned-l1s/multisig-setup/ReadPoAManager.tsx";

After completing the multi-sig setup, it's important to verify that everything is configured correctly. This tool allows you to read and inspect your PoA Manager contract.

## What to Verify

Use this tool to check:

- **Owner**: Should be your Safe/Ash wallet address
- **Validator Manager**: Should point to the correct VMC address
- **Events**: Review any emitted events to track the contract's history

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
    <ReadPoAManager />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## Expected Values

| Function | Expected Value |
|----------|----------------|
| `owner()` | Your Safe/Ash wallet address |
| `validatorManager()` | Your VMC address on C-Chain |

## Troubleshooting

### Owner is Wrong

If the `owner()` doesn't match your Safe address:
- Verify you used the correct Safe address during deployment
- Check if ownership was transferred after deployment

### Validator Manager is Wrong

If the `validatorManager()` is incorrect:
- The PoA Manager was deployed with the wrong VMC address
- You'll need to redeploy the PoA Manager with the correct address

### No Events Found

If there are no events:
- The contract may not have been used yet (normal for new deployments)
- Events will appear after validator operations are performed

## Multi-Sig Setup Complete

Congratulations! You've successfully set up multi-sig governance for your permissioned L1:

1. ✅ Deployed VMC on C-Chain
2. ✅ Created a Safe/Ash multi-sig wallet
3. ✅ Deployed PoA Manager with Safe as owner
4. ✅ Transferred VMC ownership to PoA Manager
5. ✅ Verified the complete setup

## Next Chapter

In the next chapter, **PoA Operations**, you'll learn how to perform validator operations through your new multi-sig setup:

- Adding validators via Safe
- Changing validator weights
- Removing validators

The operations themselves are similar to what you learned earlier, but now require multi-sig approval through your Safe wallet.
