Rate limiting is managed through a weighted scoring system, known as Compute Units (CUs). Each API request consumes a specified number of CUs, determined by the complexity of the request. This system is designed to accommodate basic requests while efficiently handling more computationally intensive operations.

## Rate Limit Tiers

The maximum CUs (rate-limiting score) for a user depends on their subscription level and is delineated in the following table:

| Subscription Level | Per Minute Limit (CUs) | Per Day Limit (CUs) |
| :----------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------ |
| Unauthenticated    | 6,000                  | 1,200,000           |
| Free               | 8,000                  | 2,000,000           |
| Base               | 10,000                 | 3,750,000           |
| Growth             | 14,000                 | 11,200,000          |
| Pro                | 20,000                 | 25,000,000          |

<Info> Note: Rate limits apply collectively across both Webhooks and Data APIs, with usage from each counting toward your total CU limit. </Info>

## Rate Limit Categories

The CUs for each category are defined in the following table:

| Weight | CU Value |
| :----- | :------- |
| Free   | 1        |
| Small  | 10       |
| Medium | 20       |
| Large  | 50       |
| XL     | 100      |
| XXL    | 200      |

## Rate Limits for Webhook Endpoints

The CUs for each route are defined in the table below:

| Endpoint                                    | Method | Weight | CU Value |
| :------------------------------------------ | :----- | :----- | :------- |
| `/v1/webhooks`                              | POST   | Medium | 20       |
| `/v1/webhooks`                              | GET    | Small  | 10       |
| `/v1/webhooks/{id}`                         | GET    | Small  | 10       |
| `/v1/webhooks/{id}`                         | DELETE | Medium | 20       |
| `/v1/webhooks/{id}`                         | PATCH  | Medium | 20       |
| `/v1/webhooks:generateOrRotateSharedSecret` | POST   | Medium | 20       |
| `/v1/webhooks:getSharedSecret`              | GET    | Small  | 10       |
| `/v1/webhooks/{id}/addresses`               | PATCH  | Medium | 20       |
| `/v1/webhooks/{id}/addresses`               | DELETE | Medium | 20       |
| `/v1/webhooks/{id}/addresses`               | GET    | Medium | 20       |
