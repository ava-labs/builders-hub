# Deploy NativeTokenHome

The `NativeTokenHome` contract is deployed on Fuji C-Chain. It locks wrapped AVAX (WAVAX) when users bridge to your L1 and releases it when they bridge back.

## Understanding NativeTokenHome

The NativeTokenHome contract:

- **Wraps and locks AVAX** when users bridge to your L1
- **Releases AVAX** when users bridge back from your L1
- **Uses WAVAX** as the underlying ERC-20 representation
- **Manages remote contract registrations** for security

## WAVAX on Fuji

Fuji C-Chain already has a deployed wrapped AVAX (WAVAX) contract. The toolbox will automatically detect and use it.

<Callout type="info">
**WAVAX** is an ERC-20 wrapper for native AVAX. When you deposit AVAX, you receive WAVAX. When you withdraw, you get AVAX back. This allows native tokens to be used in ERC-20 compatible contracts.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect to Fuji C-Chain

Ensure your wallet is connected to **Fuji C-Chain**. The toolbox will detect the chain and show relevant options.

</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy NativeTokenHome

Use the Deploy Token Home tool below:

1. Select **"Native Token"** as the Transferrer Type
2. Verify the **Wrapped Token Address** (WAVAX) is populated
3. Confirm the **Teleporter Registry** address is set

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Connected your Core Wallet to Fuji testnet
2. Sufficient test AVAX for gas fees
3. Selected "Native Token" as the transferrer type
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <DeployTokenHome />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Save the Contract Address

After deployment, save the **Token Home Address**. You'll need it when deploying the NativeTokenRemote contract on your L1.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Contract State After Deployment

After deployment, your NativeTokenHome:

- ✅ Is linked to WAVAX on Fuji
- ✅ Is connected to the Teleporter Registry for ICM
- ✅ Is ready to accept remote contract registrations
- ❌ Has no remote contracts registered yet

## Next Steps

Now deploy `NativeTokenRemote` on your L1 to complete the bridge setup.
