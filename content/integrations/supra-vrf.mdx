## Overview

For Web3 dApps, you need randomness that's decentralized and verifiably recorded on-chain.

That’s exactly what Supra dVRF solves. With a novel on-chain randomness generation mechanism, Supra’s decentralized dVRF is designed to power dApps with effectively random outcomes that are responsive, scalable, and easily verifiable.

- **Low-Latency Response**: The novel architecture of Supra dVRFs can compute and ship random outcomes in just moments, not minutes.

- **Designed to Scale**: Our network leverages batching to achieve greater network efficiency as well as lower costs.

- **Truly Decentralized**: Supra dVRFs use a secret sharing algorithm to distribute power across multiple nodes, so no one node has the power to compromise your apps or users.

- **Natively Cross-chain**: Supra dVRF solves on-chain randomness for Web3 at large, not just a few networks. We’re already on 27 networks like Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon.

## Documentation

1. **Supra dVRF**: Integrate [Supra dVRF](https://docs.supra.com/dvrf/build-with-supra-dvrf/getting-started) for tamper-proof, unbiased, and cryptographically verifiable random numbers to be employed by smart contracts. You can also explore Supra dVRF dashboard [HERE.](https://supra.com/data/dvrf)

2. **Explore Supra's Layer 1**: Check [Docs](https://docs.supra.com/) to start building with the Full Supra Stack.

## Get Started

Supra’s dVRF can provide the exact properties required for a random number generator (RNG) to be fair with tamper-proof, unbiased, and cryptographically verifiable random numbers to be employed by smart contracts.

- **Unbiased and Unpredictable** - The threshold signature of the nonce, client-provided input, and blockhash of the transaction that requests the randomness (which is unknown at the time of request) is used as the seed for the RNG function.

- **Tamper Proof and Verifiable** - Cryptographic proof will be provided to verify that random numbers were generated and communicated with the highest fidelity.

## How to subscribe to consume random numbers:

#### Subscription Model

Think of it like a prepaid phone plan, but for random numbers. You deposit funds upfront, and Supra uses them to pay gas fees for your VRF callbacks.

- **Predictable costs:** Set gas limits upfront, no surprises

- **Simplified contracts:** Your VRF consumer contracts don't need to handle payments

- **Bulk management:** One subscription can serve multiple contracts

- **Reliability:** Reserved minimum balance ensures your requests don't fail due to insufficient funds

#### Why use subscriptions?

- You create a subscription with your wallet address as the manager.

- Deposit funds into your subscription account.

- Register (whitelist) your smart contracts under this subscription.

- When your contracts request random numbers, Supra automatically pays the callback gas fees from your subscription balance.

- No need to handle gas payments in your contract code - it's all automated!

**To start using dVRF, you need to create a subscription that will manage your random number requests and handle gas payments for callbacks. You can create a subscription in two ways: using the new web interface or through on-chain functions.**

1. **Via the web interface**: The easiest way to create your dVRF subscription is through subscription manager UI at [supra.com/data/dvrf.](https://supra.com/data/dvrf)


2. **Via Onchain functions**: For developers who prefer programmatic subscription creation, you can interact directly with the smart contracts.

- EVM Chains

```
// Interface for dVRF 3.0 Deposit Contract
interface IDeposit {
    function addClientToWhitelist(
        uint128 maxGasPrice, 
        uint128 maxGasLimit
    ) external payable;
}
```

- Supra L1

```
// Create subscription on Supra L1
public entry fun create_subscription(
    sender: &signer,
    max_gas_fee: u64,
    initial_deposit: u64
) {
    // Call the deposit module to create subscription
    deposit::add_client_to_whitelist(sender, max_gas_fee);
    deposit::deposit_fund(sender, initial_deposit);
}
```

- **Verification**: Use web interface or getSubscriptionByClient() function, After creating your subscription, verify it's working correctly.
