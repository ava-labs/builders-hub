## Understanding GTM in the Web3 Context

A Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy is a comprehensive plan that outlines how a company will reach target customers and achieve a competitive advantage. In the Web3 space, this process requires special consideration of blockchain technology's unique positioning, customer education needs, and community-building requirements.

Web3 startups face different challenges than traditional companies. Potential clients often fall into two categories: those extremely interested in blockchain technology and those concerned about its privacy and security implications. This dichotomy requires a flexible, education-focused approach to market penetration.
