## Why Legal Structures Matter for Web3 Startups
Proper legal structuring is not just about complianceâ€”it's about creating a foundation for sustainable growth. Common mistakes that can lead to serious legal issues include:

1. **Misclassifying tokens**: Incorrectly labeling a security as a utility token can trigger Securities and Exchange Comission (SEC) enforcement actions.
2. **Operating without a legal entity**: This exposes founders to personal liability and complicates banking, taxes, and property management.
3. **Neglecting compliance requirements**: Failing to implement KYC/AML procedures can result in regulatory penalties.
4. **Making investment-style promises**: Even with a utility token, marketing language suggesting investment returns can trigger securities regulations.
5. **Inadequate IP protection**: Without proper agreements, especially when working with contractors or anonymous developers, you risk losing ownership of your product.
