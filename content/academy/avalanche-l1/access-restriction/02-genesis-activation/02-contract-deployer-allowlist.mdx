## Overview

The **Contract Deployer AllowList** precompile controls **who can deploy smart contracts** on your Avalanche L1. If an address is not allowed, contract deployment transactions will revert.

- **Precompile address**: `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000`
- **Genesis config key**: `contractDeployerAllowListConfig`
- **Permission model**: uses the [AllowList interface](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/allowlist-interface)

This is commonly used to:

- Prevent malicious or unreviewed contract deployments
- Enforce “only approved deployers” policies (CI/CD wallets, audited teams)
- Run curated ecosystems with stronger guarantees

## Genesis activation

To enable it from genesis, include a config block like - the Console will have a toggle button to do this automatically:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "contractDeployerAllowListConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x...yourAdminAddress"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `adminAddresses` become **AllowList Admins** for this precompile.
