This course focuses on two precompiles that control **who can interact** with your Avalanche L1:

| Precompile | Controls | Address |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **Transaction AllowList** | Who can submit transactions | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000002` |
| **Contract Deployer AllowList** | Who can deploy contracts | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000` |

Both use the same [AllowList interface](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/allowlist-interface) for role management.

## Transaction AllowList

Controls **who can submit transactions** to your L1. If a wallet address is not allowed, transactions from that address will fail before execution.

- **Genesis config key**: `txAllowListConfig`

## Contract Deployer AllowList

Controls **who can deploy smart contracts** on your L1. If an address is not allowed, contract deployment transactions will revert.

- **Genesis config key**: `contractDeployerAllowListConfig`

## Genesis Activation

To enable these precompiles from genesis, include their config blocks. The Console will have toggle buttons to do this automatically:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "txAllowListConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x...yourAdminAddress"]
    },
    "contractDeployerAllowListConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x...yourAdminAddress"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `adminAddresses` become **AllowList Admins** for each precompile (can manage Admin/Manager/Enabled roles).

In the next step, you'll create an L1 with both precompiles enabled.
