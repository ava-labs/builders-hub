## Managing First Customer Relationships

### Setting the Foundation for Case Studies

Your relationships with first customers will define your future sales success. Every subsequent sales call will include questions about these initial implementations.

Before beginning work with early customers, visualize the case study you want to write. Work backward from there to ensure you achieve compelling results that will impress future prospects.

Focus case studies on clear key performance indicators (KPIs), typically centered around:
- Increased revenue
- Reduced costs
- Improved efficiency
- Enhanced user experience

Stay disciplined about measuring these metrics and avoid distractions that don't contribute to your core value proposition.

### Maintaining Communication Channels

Establish regular communication with all stakeholders at your customer organizations. Set up recurring weekly or monthly meetings from the startâ€”it's easier to cancel unnecessary meetings than to reschedule when issues arise.

Connect with both buyers and users to understand how your product functions in real-world conditions. Watch for unexpected use cases and feature preferences that might reveal new market opportunities.

### Structuring Early Engagements

Frame early customer engagements as pilots or proof-of-concepts with defined timelines and success criteria. This approach:
- Reduces perceived risk for enterprise customers
- Creates natural checkpoints for evaluation
- Sets clear expectations about feedback and iteration
- Establishes a pathway to expanded deployment

This structure makes large organizations more comfortable working with early-stage startups while ensuring you receive the input needed to refine your product.
