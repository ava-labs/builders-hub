- **Separate visuals from script**: Create simple slides with visual cues, not text-heavy information dumps.

- **Structure as a complete story**: Use narrative frameworks like Hero's Journey, Bridge Story, or Twist Ending to engage investors emotionally.

- **Translate complexity through metaphors**: Compare technical concepts to Web3 solutions investors know, then to real-world experiences they understand.

- **Build credibility honestly**: Own your current stage while demonstrating dedication through the Context, Content, and Climb framework.

- **Take calculated presentation risks**: Show your authentic self, share personal connections to your work, and leave strategic information gaps.

- **Prepare thoroughly for five-minute pitches**: Create a minimal deck, memorize your script, edit ruthlessly, and anticipate Q&A.

- **Focus on change created**: When discussing communities or tokens, emphasize the transformation they enable, not just how they work.
