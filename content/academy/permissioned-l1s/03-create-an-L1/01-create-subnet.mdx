In the [Avalanche Fundamentals course](/academy/avalanche-fundamentals), you learned how to quickly set up an L1 using the [Developer Console](https://build.avax.network/tools/l1-toolbox). This section provides an in depth review of that flow, understanding what comes pre-configured in our genesis, and laying the foundation for what we will need for our Permissioned L1.

## Creating a Subnet

Let's create a fresh new Subnet that we can use during this course to test all of the tools and flows for managing Permissioned L1s.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Connect & Fund Core Wallet

1. [Download Core Wallet](https://core.app/) if not already installed
2. Connect your wallet and set to Tesnet mode (upper-right toggle button)
3. Use the **faucet button** in this wallet component (below your C-chain balance) to claim **test AVAX on the C-Chain**
4. Use the same button (but below P-Chain balance) to claim **test AVAX on the P-Chain**

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain"/>

</Step>
<Step>

### Create Subnet and Blockchain Records

Create the Subnet by issuing two transactions on the P-Chain (hence the need for test AVAX on the P-chain).

These transactions are:
1. `CreateSubnetTx` - Creates a Subnet identified by the transaction hash
2. `CreateChainTx` - Adds a blockchain to the Subnet

For this guide, we will create our blockchain as an **uncustomized EVM** so you just need to rename it (if you want). 

On **Step 2: Create a Chain** select the *Genesis JSON* tab to the right and skim through it. No need to understand it all but good to get familiar with it before the next section.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
    <CreateChain />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

**Key Parameters:**
- **Subnet Owner**: P-chain address of your connected wallet
- **Chain Name**: Your blockchain's name
- **VM ID**: Default value `srEX...Dy` when creating with an uncustomized VM
- **Genesis Data**: Initial blockchain configuration

</Step>
<Step>

### Set Up Validator Node

Launch a node to track your Subnet using Docker. This node will become a validator for your Subnet, and later will be managed by the Validator Manager contract when we convert to L1.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="testnet-mainnet">
    <AvalancheGoDocker />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Key Takeaways

- **P-Chain Registry**: All validators and blockchains are registered on the P-Chain
- **Subnet Foundation**: Your Subnet provides the blockchain infrastructure necessary for this course
