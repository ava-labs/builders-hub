# ERC-20 to Native Token Bridge

In this chapter, you'll bridge **real USDC** from Fuji C-Chain to your own L1, where it becomes the **native gas token**.

## The Exercise

You will:

1. Get **1 USDC** from the Circle faucet on Fuji
2. Create an L1 with **Native Minter** enabled
3. Deploy a bridge that converts USDC → Native tokens
4. Bridge your 1 USDC to become 1 native token on your L1

<Callout type="info">
**USDC on Fuji C-Chain**: `0x5425890298aed601595a70AB815c96711a31Bc65`

Get testnet USDC from the [Circle Faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/) (select "Avalanche Fuji" network, 1 USDC per request).
</Callout>

## Use Case

This bridge type is ideal when:

- You want to use an **established stablecoin** (like USDC) as your chain's gas currency
- You need **predictable gas costs** for users (no volatile native token)
- You're building for **enterprise or regulated environments** that prefer fiat-pegged tokens

## Architecture Overview

## Contracts Involved

| Contract | Chain | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **USDC** | Fuji C-Chain | The ERC-20 token we're bridging (`0x5425890298aed601595a70AB815c96711a31Bc65`) |
| **ERC20TokenHome** | Fuji C-Chain | Locks USDC when bridging out, releases when bridging back |
| **NativeTokenRemote** | Your L1 | Calls Native Minter to create native tokens |
| **Native Minter Precompile** | Your L1 | System contract that mints native tokens |

## Key Requirement: Native Minter Precompile

Your L1 must have the **Native Minter precompile** enabled. This precompile:

- Is a built-in Avalanche L1 feature
- Allows authorized contracts to mint native tokens
- Must be configured in the chain's genesis
- Address: `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001`

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: You'll create an L1 with Native Minter enabled as the first step of this chapter.
</Callout>

## Collateral Requirement

Native-token bridging requires **collateral** to back the minted supply:

1. **Initial Reserve Imbalance**: Set during NativeTokenRemote deployment (we'll use `1 USDC`)
2. **Collateral Deposit**: USDC deposited to back the minted native supply
3. **Full Collateralization**: Required before bridging is enabled

Since the Circle faucet gives you 1 USDC, we'll create an L1 with an initial supply backed by that 1 USDC.

## Deployment Flow

| Step | Action | Chain |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Get 1 USDC from Circle faucet | Fuji C-Chain |
| 2 | Create L1 with Native Minter | Fuji (P-Chain) |
| 3 | Set up relayer | Local (Docker) |
| 4 | Deploy ERC20TokenHome for USDC | Fuji C-Chain |
| 5 | Deploy NativeTokenRemote | Your L1 |
| 6 | Register + Collateralize with 1 USDC | Your L1 → Fuji |
| 7 | Bridge USDC → Native | Fuji → Your L1 |

## What You'll Achieve

By the end of this chapter:

- ✅ Your L1 uses **USDC as the native gas token**
- ✅ You've bridged 1 USDC to get 1 native token on your L1
- ✅ The bridge is fully collateralized and secure

<Callout type="info">
**Token Backing**: Every native token minted on your L1 is backed 1:1 by USDC locked in the ERC20TokenHome contract on Fuji.
</Callout>

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:

1. **Test AVAX** on Fuji C-Chain for gas fees ([Fuji Faucet](/console/primary-network/faucet))
2. **1 USDC** on Fuji C-Chain from the [Circle Faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/)
3. **Core Wallet** browser extension installed

Let's get started by getting USDC and creating your L1!
