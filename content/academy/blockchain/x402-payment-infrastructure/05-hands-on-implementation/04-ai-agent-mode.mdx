## Why AI Agents Need Autonomous Payments

In previous lessons, you experienced the human payment flow: click a button, sign a transaction, receive content. This works well for humans but creates friction for AI agents that need to:

- Make hundreds or thousands of small payments automatically
- Operate without human intervention for each transaction
- Access paid services programmatically

Traditional payment systems require human-centric verification (CAPTCHA, KYC, manual approvals) that AI agents cannot complete. x402 solves this by enabling **signature-based payments** that can be automated.

## Two AI Agent Modes

The x402 starter kit demonstrates two approaches to AI-powered payments:

### 1. Token-Based AI Chat

A pay-per-use chatbot where you pay based on actual token consumption:

- **Pricing**: \$0.001 per 1,000 tokens (with a \$0.50 max cap per message)
- **Scheme**: "upto" - authorize a maximum, pay only what you use
- **Use case**: Variable-cost AI interactions where usage differs per request

### 2. Autonomous AI Agent

A fully autonomous agent that manages its own wallet and budget:

- **Pricing**: Fixed $0.02 per service call (cryptocurrency price lookups)
- **Scheme**: "exact" - pay the specified amount per request
- **Use case**: Automated services that need to operate independently

## Key Concepts

### Agent Wallets

Unlike human payment mode where your main wallet signs each transaction, the autonomous agent uses a **dedicated agent wallet**:

1. **Separate from your main wallet**: Your funds stay secure
2. **Encrypted in browser**: Private key is encrypted using your wallet address
3. **Pre-funded with budget**: You transfer USDC to set spending limits
4. **Signs autonomously**: No popups or confirmations per transaction

### Budget Authorization

Instead of approving each payment, you authorize a **budget** upfront:

1. Create an agent wallet (one-time setup)
2. Fund it with USDC (e.g., $0.75 default budget)
3. The agent spends from this budget automatically
4. Withdraw remaining funds when done

### Gasless Payments

Both AI agent modes use the same gasless payment mechanism as human payments:

- Users sign EIP-712 authorizations (not transactions)
- The facilitator submits on-chain transactions
- No AVAX needed in the agent wallet - only USDC

## Switching to AI Agent Mode

In the starter kit interface:

1. Look for the **mode tabs** at the top of the page
2. Click **"AI Agent"** to switch from Human Payment mode
3. You'll see two sub-modes: **Token-Chat** and **Autonomous-Agents**

The following lessons will walk you through each mode in detail.
