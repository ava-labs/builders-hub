          Returns a list of transactions where the given wallet address had an
          on-chain interaction for the given chain. The ERC-20 transfers,
          ERC-721 transfers, ERC-1155, and internal transactions returned are
          only those where the input address had an interaction. Specifically,
          those lists only inlcude entries where the input address was the
          sender (`from` field) or the receiver (`to` field) for the
          sub-transaction. Therefore the transactions returned from this list
          may not be complete representations of the on-chain data. For a
          complete view of a transaction use the
          `/chains/:chainId/transactions/:txHash` endpoint.


          Filterable by block ranges.
