- **Be specific about your target audience**: Avoid broad definitions and drill down into detailed demographics and psychographics.

- **Focus on solving real problems**: Your primary goal should be providing value to users, not creating a speculative token.

- **Consider multiple stakeholders**: In Web3, your "customers" may include token holders, community members, and contributors.

- **Plan for revenue from day one**: Even with an evolving business model, you need to consider sustainability strategies early.

- **Validate before building**: Talk to potential users and understand their needs before developing extensive features.

- **Iterate based on feedback**: Use the canvas as a living document that evolves as you learn more about your market.
