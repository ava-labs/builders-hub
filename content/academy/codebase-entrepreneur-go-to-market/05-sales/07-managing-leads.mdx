### Implementing a CRM System

From day one, use a customer relationship management (CRM) system to track leads and follow-ups. Start with simple tools like Airtable, then migrate to more comprehensive systems like HubSpot or Pipedrive as your pipeline grows.

Choose platforms that integrate with your email system to automatically record contacts and conversations. Set up automated reminders for follow-ups to ensure no prospect falls through the cracks.

This systematic approach removes emotion from the process, helping you maintain momentum despite inevitable rejections and non-responses.

### Building Your Prospect List

Continuously add potential contacts from industry events, social media, and news articles. Maintain this database even when prospects aren't immediately relevantâ€”you never know when a connection might become valuable.

Having a deep bench of potential outreach targets prevents pipeline drought and ensures you always have fresh conversations to initiate when current leads stall.
