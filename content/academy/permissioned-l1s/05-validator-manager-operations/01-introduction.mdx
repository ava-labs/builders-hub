This module covers the end-to-end validator lifecycle on a permissioned L1 managed by the `ValidatorManager` contract:

- Add a validator (initiate on L1, register on P-Chain, complete on L1)
- Change validator weight (churn-aware updates)
- Remove a validator (initiate on L1, remove on P-Chain, complete on L1)
- Disable on P-Chain for emergency/operational purposes
