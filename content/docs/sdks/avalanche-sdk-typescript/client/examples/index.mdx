# Avalanche SDK Client Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating how to use the `@avalanche-sdk/client` package to interact with the Avalanche blockchain.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher
- **npm**: Latest version recommended
- **TypeScript**: Examples are written in TypeScript

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using the Latest Released Version

1. **Navigate to the examples directory:**
   ```bash
   cd client/examples
   ```

2. **Install the latest SDK version:**
   ```bash
   npm install @avalanche-sdk/client@latest
   ```

3. **Run any example:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx <example-file.ts>
   ```

### Option 2: Using a Local Development Build

1. **Build the SDK from source:**
   ```bash
   # From the project root
   npm run build:all
   ```

2. **Create a global symlink:**
   ```bash
   npm link
   ```

3. **Navigate to examples and link to local build:**
   ```bash
   cd client/examples
   npm link @avalanche-sdk/client
   ```

4. **Run any example:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx <example-file.ts>
   ```

> **Note:** Make sure to create your own `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file and updating the values. You'll also need to modify the `config.ts` file to point to your `.env` file path. By default, the examples use the values from `.env.example`, and the test addresses mentioned in the examples as comments (like `0x76Dd3d7b2f635c2547B861e55aE8A374E587742D` and `X-fuji19fc97zn3mzmwr827j4d3n45refkksgms4y2yzz`) are derived from the private key values in that file.

## Available Examples

### Basic Examples
- **`sendAvax.ts`** - Basic AVAX transfer example

### React Web Application Examples
Located in `react-show-balance-and-cross-chain-transfers/`:

#### Overview
The React examples demonstrate how to build a modern web application that integrates with the Avalanche blockchain using the SDK. These examples showcase:

- **Wallet Integration**: Connecting to Core browser extension via EIP-1193 provider
- **Balance Display**: Real-time P-Chain and C-Chain AVAX balance monitoring
- **Cross-Chain Transfers**: Seamless AVAX transfers between Platform and Contract chains
- **Network Switching**: Dynamic switching between Fuji testnet and Mainnet
- **Modern UI**: Built with Material-UI and React 18, featuring responsive design

#### Key Features
- **Real-time Balance Updates**: Automatic balance refresh every 20 seconds
- **Chain-Specific Logic**: Different handling for P-Chain (Platform) vs C-Chain (Contract)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with adaptive layouts
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper type definitions

#### Required Polyfills
Due to the Node.js environment assumptions in the Avalanche SDK, several polyfills are required for browser compatibility:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  define: {
    // Polyfill Node.js globals for browser environment
    global: "globalThis",
    "process.env": {},
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      // Polyfill Node.js modules
      process: "process/browser",
      util: "util",
    },
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    include: ["process", "util"],
  },
});
```

**Dependencies to install:**
```bash
npm install process util
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

**What are Polyfills?**
Polyfills are code that implements a feature on web browsers that do not support that feature. In this case, some dependencies in the Avalanche SDK was designed for Node.js environments and uses Node.js-specific modules like `process` and `util`. Since browsers don't have these modules, we need to provide browser-compatible versions. Learn more about polyfills in the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill) and [web.dev](https://web.dev/polyfills/).

#### Running the React Examples
1. **Navigate to the React examples directory:**
   ```bash
   cd react-show-balance-and-cross-chain-transfers
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Primary Network Transaction Examples
Located in `prepare-primary-network-txns/`:

#### Cross-Chain Transfers
- **`transfer-avax-from-x-chain-to-p-chain.ts`** - Transfer AVAX from X-Chain to P-Chain
- **`transfer-avax-from-p-chain-to-x-chain.ts`** - Transfer AVAX from P-Chain to X-Chain
- **`transfer-avax-from-x-chain-to-c-chain.ts`** - Transfer AVAX from X-Chain to C-Chain
- **`transfer-avax-from-c-chain-to-x-chain.ts`** - Transfer AVAX from C-Chain to X-Chain
- **`transfer-avax-from-p-chain-to-c-chain.ts`** - Transfer AVAX from P-Chain to C-Chain
- **`transfer-avax-from-c-chain-to-p-chain.ts`** - Transfer AVAX from C-Chain to P-Chain

#### Chain-Specific Examples
- **`x-chain/`** - X-Chain specific operations
- **`p-chain/`** - P-Chain specific operations  
- **`c-chain/`** - C-Chain specific operations

## Configuration

Most examples require configuration before running:

1. **Network Selection**: Examples default to Fuji testnet. Modify the network configuration in each example file to use mainnet or local network.

2. **Private Keys**: Copy the example environment file in .env and edit with your actual values

3. **Addresses**: Update recipient addresses to valid Avalanche addresses.

## Security Notes

- **Never commit your `.env` file** - it contains sensitive private keys
- **Use testnet keys** for development and testing
- **Keep your mainnet private keys secure** and offline

## Important Notes

- **Testnet Usage**: Examples are configured for Fuji testnet by default. Use testnet AVAX for experimentation.
- **Security**: Never commit private keys or sensitive information to version control.
- **Node Version**: Ensure you're using Node.js version 20 or higher for compatibility.
- **Browser Compatibility**: React examples require modern browsers with ES2020+ support.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot find module" errors:**
   - Ensure you've installed dependencies: `npm install`
   - Check that you're in the correct directory

2. **TypeScript compilation errors:**
   - Verify Node.js version: `node --version`
   - Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

3. **Network connection issues:**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the RPC endpoint is accessible
   - Consider using a different RPC provider

4. **React examples not working in browser:**
   - Ensure all polyfills are properly configured
   - Check browser console for polyfill-related errors
   - Verify that `process` and `util` packages are installed

### React-Specific Issues

1. **"process is not defined" errors:**
   - Ensure polyfills are properly configured in `vite.config.ts`
   - Check that `process` package is installed

2. **"global is not defined" errors:**
   - Verify `global: "globalThis"` is set in Vite config
   - This is required for Node.js compatibility in browsers
