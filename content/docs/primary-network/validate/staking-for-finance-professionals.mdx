# AVAX Staking for Professionals

A comprehensive guide to Avalanche staking designed for financial professionals who need to understand the mechanics, risks, and operational considerations of staking without deep technical knowledge.

## Executive Summary

Staking on Avalanche allows token holders to earn rewards by participating in network security. Unlike traditional investments, staked tokens remain under your custody but are time-locked for a predetermined period (2 weeks to 1 year). At the end of the staking period, your original principal is returned along with earned rewards.

<Callout type="error" title="Critical Risk Considerations">
**Before staking, understand these key risks:**

- **No Slashing** - Avalanche does NOT have slashing. Your staked principal is never at risk of being taken by the protocol or validators, regardless of validator performance. The worst-case scenario is earning zero rewards, not losing your principal.

- **Assets Are Locked** - Once assets are staked, they must remain staked until the end of the staking period. You set the maturity date, but your assets are completely illiquid until that date.

- **Irreversible Transaction** - Once a staking transaction is confirmed on the P-Chain, it cannot be changed. There is NO mechanism for early withdrawal or changing transaction settings. Plan your liquidity accordingly and double-check all inputs.

## Understanding Staking

Staking is the process of locking up cryptocurrency holdings to support a blockchain network's security and validate transactions. Stakers earn rewards (similar to interest) for helping secure the network.

On Avalanche, there are two types of staking:

- **Validation Staking** - Running node infrastructure and staking to become a validator
- **Delegation Staking** - Staking assets to someone else's existing validator

## Validator vs. Delegator Comparison

| Aspect | Validator | Delegator |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Role** | Operates node infrastructure and stakes to make the node a validator | Stakes assets to an existing validator without running infrastructure |
| **Category** | Advanced | User-Friendly |
| **Minimum Capital** | 2,000 AVAX | 25 AVAX |
| **Maximum Stake** | 3,000,000 AVAX | Dependent on validator's available capacity |
| **Hardware Required** | Yes (8-core CPU, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) | No |
| **Technical Knowledge** | High (Linux, networking, DevOps) | None required |
| **Operational Burden** | Monitoring and maintenance of infrastructure | Zero operational burden |
| **Providers** | Can contract node providers to manage infrastructure externally | Select from public marketplace through most staking apps |
| **Risk Profile** | Operational and reputational risk | Minimal (validator selection risk only) |
| **Revenue Stream** | Own validator rewards + delegation fees from delegators | Own delegation rewards minus delegation fee |
| **Operational Costs** | Infrastructure cost of maintaining nodes | N/A (validator's responsibility) |
| **Fees** | Trivial transaction fee at onset | Transaction fee + delegation fee to validator |
| **Uptime Requirements** | Must maintain >80% uptime for rewards | N/A (validator's responsibility) |
| **Liquidity** | Locked during staking period | Locked during staking period |

## Preparation: Set Up Your Wallet and Assets

Before staking (for either validating or delegating), you need to prepare the following.

<Callout type="info" title="Non-Custodial Design">
At every stage, you retain ownership of your private keys. The validator never has access to your funds for either form of staking. The time-lock is enforced by the Avalanche protocol, not by any third party.

**Note:** If you are using a third-party intermediary, you're subject to their restrictions and functions.
</Callout>

### Asset Requirements

| Aspect | Applies To | Details |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Asset Location** | Validators and Delegators | AVAX tokens should reside in your P-Chain wallet address |
| **Ownership** | Validators and Delegators | You hold the private keys; you have full control of your assets |
| **Liquidity** | Validators and Delegators | Fully liquid. Time-vested assets are eligible to be staked |

### Required Addresses

All addresses below are P-Chain addresses:

| Address | Staking Type | Purpose | Details |
|---------|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Validator Principal Address** | Validators Only | Source of funds to be staked | Chosen by validator. In most setups, this is where principal returns. |
| **Validator Rewards Address** | Validators Only | Where validator rewards are sent after staking ends | Chosen by validator |
| **Delegation Fee Address** | Validators Only | Where fees from delegators are sent | Chosen by validator |
| **Delegator Principal Address** | Delegators Only | Source of funds to be staked | Chosen by delegator. In most setups, this is where principal returns. |
| **Delegator Rewards Address** | Delegators Only | Where delegator rewards are sent after staking ends | Chosen by delegator |

### P-Chain vs. C-Chain

<Callout type="warn" title="Important: Staking Requires P-Chain">
Staking occurs on the **P-Chain** (Platform Chain), not the C-Chain. If your AVAX is on the C-Chain (used for DeFi/smart contracts), you must first transfer it to the P-Chain.
</Callout>

### Cross-Chain Transfer: C-Chain → P-Chain

If your AVAX is on the C-Chain (common for exchange withdrawals and DeFi), transfer it to the P-Chain before staking.

**Fees:** Each transaction costs approximately 0.001 AVAX. Total transfer cost: ~0.002 AVAX.

| Step | Transaction Type | Chain | What It Does |
|------|------------------|-------|--------------|
| Export | `ExportTx` | C-Chain | Assets move out of C-Chain |
| Import | `ImportTx` | P-Chain | Assets move into P-Chain |

**Wallets Supporting Cross-Chain:** [Core Wallet](https://core.app/) and most Avalanche-compatible wallets provide a single "Cross-Chain Transfer" button that executes both transactions automatically.

## Steps for Validating

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
You should have a node selected and prepared before creating a staking transaction—either one you're operating yourself or one provided by a contracted node provider.
</Callout>

### Validation Transaction Parameters

Create a staking transaction by providing the following:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Node ID** | Unique identifier of the validator node | `NodeID-A1B2C3D4E5F6...` |
| **Node BLS Public Key** | 48-byte hex representation used to create verifiable signatures | `0x87772ac7668d78d...` |
| **Node BLS Proof of Possession** | 96-byte hex signature proving control of the private key | `0x969d9ffbe8d00ed83b...` |
| **Stake Amount** | Amount of AVAX to stake (minimum 2,000 AVAX) | `2,500 AVAX` |
| **Delegation Fee %** | Fee charged to delegators (must be 2%–100%) | `2.0%` |
| **Start Time** | When staking begins (usually immediately upon transaction) | `2026-02-01 00:00:00 UTC` |
| **End Time** | When staking ends (2 weeks to 1 year from start) | `2026-08-01 00:00:00 UTC` |
| **Stake Return Address** | Where original principal returns | `P-avax1abc123...` |
| **Validator Rewards Address** | Where validator rewards are sent | `P-avax1abc123...` |
| **Delegation Fee Address** | Where delegation fees are sent | `P-avax1abc123...` |

### After Submitting the Transaction

- Once the transaction completes, the node is considered **active** until the maturity date
- The node must maintain **greater than 80% uptime** to receive rewards
- Once active, others may delegate to the node
- Delegators can stake to your validator up until the last two weeks of your validation period

### Validator Delegation Capacity

Validators can accept delegations up to a calculated capacity:

```
Validator Delegation Capacity = ((3,000,000 AVAX - (5 × Validator Stake Amount)) - Validator Stake Amount) - Active Delegation Stake
```

---

## Steps for Delegating

You can only delegate to a node that already has an active validation stake. Delegation is limited by the validator you select:

- **Maximum delegation amount** depends on validator capacity
- **Delegation period** must end before the validator's staking period ends

<Callout type="warn" title="Validator Selection Risk">
When you delegate, your rewards depend on the validator's uptime. If it falls below 80% during the staking period, you risk receiving zero rewards.

Choose a validator you're familiar with or one that has trustworthy indicators such as healthy uptime and a history of successful validation periods.
</Callout>

### Delegation Transaction Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Node ID** | Unique identifier of the validator you're delegating to | `NodeID-A1B2C3D4E5F6...` |
| **Stake Amount** | Amount to delegate (min 25 AVAX, max set by validator capacity) | `30 AVAX` |
| **Start Time** | When staking begins (usually immediately) | `2026-02-01 00:00:00 UTC` |
| **End Time** | When staking ends (must be before validator's end time) | `2026-08-01 00:00:00 UTC` |
| **Stake Return Address** | Where original principal returns | `P-avax1abc123...` |
| **Delegator Rewards Address** | Where rewards are sent (minus delegation fee) | `P-avax1abc123...` |

## Monitoring Your Stake

You can monitor active or historical stakes through your wallet app (such as [Core Wallet](https://core.app/)).

Public explorer tools also provide monitoring:

- [Example Staking Transaction](https://subnets.avax.network/p-chain/tx/to2MDTr7HBkmex6q1QiCHHZa4oZaJjmp36vJjdLjQLpPQXRF2)
- [Example Delegation Transaction](https://subnets.avax.network/p-chain/tx/2DF6kRMCtpeLmx7TGaoj9PbQTWwU775c7ULU9UUuzbeizGm5h6)
- [Example Active Validator Node](https://subnets.avax.network/validators/NodeID-38NGnT4q4MXLv9vBGw72vwBgyX2Wf35iu)

---

## Rewards Distribution

<Callout type="info" title="Rewards Timing">
Rewards are **NOT** distributed incrementally during the staking period. Instead:

- Protocol calculates potential rewards based on stake amount and duration
- Actual reward is determined **ONLY** at the end of the period
- Reward depends on validator meeting 80% uptime threshold
- No "accrued but not yet received" rewards exist during the period
</Callout>

For the detailed reward calculation formula, see [Rewards Formula](/docs/primary-network/validate/rewards-formula).

Rewards are automatically distributed at the end of the staking period, and principal is sent to the predesignated address.

### Validator Rewards

| Component | Amount | Destination | When |
|-----------|--------|-------------|------|
| **Gross Validator Rewards** | Calculated by protocol | Validator Rewards Address | End of validator's staking period |
| **Delegation Fee Rewards** | Gross Delegation Rewards × Delegation Fee Rate | Delegation Fee Address | Batched at end of validator's staking period |
| **Net Validator Revenue** | Gross Validator Rewards + Delegation Fee Rewards | — | — |

Validator principal returns to the original principal address immediately at the end of the staking period.

### Delegator Rewards

| Component | Amount | Destination | When |
|-----------|--------|-------------|------|
| **Gross Delegator Rewards** | Calculated by protocol | — | — |
| **Delegation Fee** | Gross Rewards × Delegation Fee Rate | Validator's Fee Address | End of validator's staking period |
| **Net Delegator Revenue** | Gross Rewards − Delegation Fee | Delegator Rewards Address | End of **delegator's** staking period |

Delegator principal returns to the original principal address immediately at the end of the **delegator's** staking period (not the validator's).

## Coming Soon: Continuous Staking (ACP-236)

<Callout type="info" title="Proposed — Not Yet Live">
[ACP-236: Continuous Staking](/docs/acps/236-continuous-staking) is currently in **Proposed** status. The features below will require a network upgrade to implement. This section is provided for planning purposes.
</Callout>

### What Is Continuous Staking?

ACP-236 proposes a mechanism allowing validators to remain staked indefinitely without manually resubmitting staking transactions at each period's end. Instead of committing to a fixed end time, validators would specify a **cycle duration** and an **auto-renew policy**.

### Key Changes from Current System

| Aspect | Current System | With ACP-236 |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Staking Duration** | Fixed end time; must re-stake manually | Automatic renewal at cycle end |
| **Reward Handling** | All rewards returned at period end | Configurable: auto-compound or withdraw |
| **Exit Process** | Delegation simply ends | Submit `SetAutoRenewPolicyTx` to signal exit |
| **Transaction Burden** | New transaction every staking period | One transaction, runs indefinitely |
| **Uptime Tracking** | Measured over entire period | Reset each cycle |

### New Transaction Types

ACP-236 introduces three new P-Chain transactions:

| Transaction | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `AddContinuousValidatorTx` | Create a continuous validator with cycle duration and auto-renew policy |
| `SetAutoRenewPolicyTx` | Modify the auto-renew policy or signal exit at cycle end |
| `RewardContinuousValidatorTx` | Issued by block builders to process cycle rewards |

### Auto-Renew Rewards Policy

The `AutoRenewRewardsShares` field (expressed in millionths) controls what happens to rewards at each cycle end:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `0` | Restake principal only; withdraw 100% of rewards |
| `300,000` | Restake 30% of rewards; withdraw 70% |
| `1,000,000` | Restake 100% of rewards (full compounding) |
| `MaxUint64` | Signal to exit at current cycle end |

### Benefits for Financial Professionals

- **Reduced Operational Burden** — Fewer transactions to sign and manage
- **Automatic Compounding** — Rewards can auto-restake each cycle
- **Enhanced Security** — Less frequent key signing reduces exposure risk
- **Flexible Exit** — Can signal exit mid-cycle; takes effect at cycle end
- **Simpler Treasury Management** — Set-and-forget staking operations

### Impact on Delegators

<Callout type="warn" title="No Continuous Delegation">
ACP-236 applies to **validators only**. Delegators cannot delegate continuously because there is no guarantee a validator will continue beyond their current cycle. Delegation constraints remain unchanged: your delegation period must fit within the validator's current cycle.
</Callout>
