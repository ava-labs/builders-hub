Adding a validator through the multi-sig involves two phases, each requiring Safe wallet approval. This guide walks you through the complete process.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- ✅ Access to your Safe wallet at [wallet.ash.center](https://wallet.ash.center/)
- ✅ The required number of signers available
- ✅ A validator node ready to be added (Node ID and BLS public key)
- ✅ Your PoA Manager contract address

## Phase 1: Initiate Validator Registration

<Steps>
<Step>

### Access Your Safe Wallet

1. Go to [wallet.ash.center](https://wallet.ash.center/)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Select your Safe from the list
4. Navigate to **"New Transaction"** → **"Transaction Builder"**

</Step>
<Step>

### Configure the Transaction

Set up the transaction to call your PoA Manager:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **To Address** | Your PoA Manager address |
| **Value** | 0 |
| **Contract Method** | `addValidator` or use custom calldata |

</Step>
<Step>

### Enter Validator Details

You'll need to provide:

- **Node ID**: The validator's node identifier (20 bytes)
- **BLS Public Key**: The validator's BLS public key (48 bytes)
- **Weight**: The validator's voting weight
- **Remaining Balance Owner**: P-Chain address(es) to receive remaining balance
- **Disable Owner**: P-Chain address(es) that can disable the validator

<Callout type="info">
The PoA Manager simplifies parameter formatting compared to calling the Validator Manager directly. Refer to your PoA Manager's ABI for exact parameter formats.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

### Submit the Transaction

1. Review all parameters carefully
2. Click **"Create Batch"** or **"Submit"**
3. Sign the transaction with your wallet

</Step>
<Step>

### Collect Approvals

After submitting:

1. The transaction appears in the **"Queue"** tab
2. Share the transaction details with other signers
3. Each signer must:
   - Connect to the Safe
   - Review the transaction
   - Click **"Confirm"**

</Step>
<Step>

### Execute the Transaction

Once the threshold is reached:

1. Any signer can click **"Execute"**
2. Pay the gas fee to execute the transaction
3. Wait for the transaction to confirm

**Result**: A Warp message is sent to the P-Chain to register the validator.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Phase 2: Complete Validator Registration

After the P-Chain processes the registration, you need to complete it:

<Steps>
<Step>

### Monitor P-Chain Status

Wait for the P-Chain to process the registration. This typically takes a few seconds to a minute.

</Step>
<Step>

### Prepare Completion Transaction

In your Safe wallet:

1. Navigate to **"New Transaction"** → **"Transaction Builder"**
2. Set the target to your PoA Manager address
3. Call the `completeValidatorRegistration` function
4. Provide the **message index** from the P-Chain response

</Step>
<Step>

### Collect Approvals for Completion

Same process as Phase 1:

1. Submit the transaction
2. Coordinate with signers for approvals
3. Reach the required threshold

</Step>
<Step>

### Execute Completion

Execute the transaction to finalize the validator registration.

**Result**: The validator is now active and participating in consensus.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Verification

After completion, verify the validator was added:

1. Query the validator set using the [Query Validator Set tool](/academy/permissioned-l1s/05-validator-manager-operations/02-query-validator-set)
2. Check that your new validator appears with the correct weight
3. Monitor your validator node to ensure it's participating in consensus

## Tips for Smooth Operations

### Prepare Everything in Advance

Before proposing the transaction:
- Have all validator details ready
- Confirm signer availability
- Test with a smaller weight first if unsure

### Communicate with Signers

- Share the transaction link or details
- Explain what's being proposed
- Set a deadline for approvals

### Handle Timeouts

Remember: validator registrations expire after **24 hours**. If the completion phase isn't executed in time:
- The registration becomes invalid
- You'll need to clean up the expired registration
- Start the process again with a new initiation
