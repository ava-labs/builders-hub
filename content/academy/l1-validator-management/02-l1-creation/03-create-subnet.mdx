Now that you have Core wallet set up and some AVAX on the P-Chain you can create a Subnet. You will
do this by issuing a `CreateSubnetTx` transaction. This will create a Subnet that is uniquely
identified by the transaction hash of the `CreateSubnetTx` transaction.

The `CreateSubnetTx` transaction only has a single parameter: The owner of the Subnet. The owner can
add blockchains to the Subnet and convert it to an L1. With the conversion to an L1 the owner will loose it's
privileges. Therefore, the owner is only relevant during the creation time and does not have to be
secured by a mulit-sig if a immediate conversion to an L1 is planned. We will just use your P-Chain
address as the owner.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="C-chain">
    <CreateSubnet />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

When the transaction was submitted successfully, you can query the [Get Subnet details by
ID](https://developers.avacloud.io/data-api/primary-network/get-subnet-details-by-id) of the
Avalanche API with your subnetID to get more information about your Subnet.

Additionally, you can head to the [P-Chain Explorer for the Fuji
testnet](https://subnets-test.avax.network/p-chain) and search for the transaction hash to verify
the creation of the Subnet.
