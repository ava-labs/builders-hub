Privacy is not the only requirement for enterprise-grade blockchain solutions, **compliance** is equally critical.  
On Avalanche, whether you deploy to C-Chain **Mainnet**, **Fuji (Testnet)**, or a custom L1, tokens must often meet **regulatory obligations** to operate legally in certain jurisdictions or industries.

## Why Compliance Matters

In finance, healthcare, gaming, and government, compliance is not optional, it is enforced through regulations like:
- **KYC/AML** (Know Your Customer / Anti-Money Laundering): Identifying and verifying participants to prevent illegal activity.
- **Jurisdictional restrictions**: Blocking access from certain regions due to sanctions or laws.
- **Data protection laws**: GDPR (EU), HIPAA (US), and other frameworks require handling sensitive data in specific ways.

## Challenges with Current Token Standards

Standard ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 implementations on Avalanche offer **no built-in compliance tools**:
- No **whitelisting** or **blacklisting** capabilities at the protocol level.
- No **selective disclosure**: you cannot show transaction details only to authorized parties while hiding them from the public.
- No **transaction-level restrictions** to enforce rules automatically.

As a result, compliance must be built as a **custom layer**, which:
- Increases development and auditing costs.
- Introduces potential security risks if not implemented correctly.
- Creates inconsistency between projects, making interoperability harder.

## The Compliance–Privacy Balance

True privacy on Avalanche must still allow **authorized oversight**:
- **Auditor access**: Regulators, tax authorities, or compliance officers should be able to review specific transactions without making them public.
- **Selective decryption**: Only authorized entities can view transaction amounts and counterparties.
- **Revocable permissions**: The ability to update who has access without redeploying the entire token contract.

## Example in the Avalanche Ecosystem

Imagine an **L1** created for a private lending network:
- Loans are issued in a **privacy-enabled token** to protect borrower data.
- Regulators need to verify the amounts, interest rates, and repayment schedules.
- Without compliance features, the project must either make all data public (losing privacy) or create a parallel off-chain audit system (increasing complexity).

In the **next section**, we will explore **Necessities Solved with Privacy**, real-world scenarios where privacy is not just a “nice to have,” but a **critical requirement** for operations, security, and compliance.
