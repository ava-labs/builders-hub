A comprehensive Web3 pricing framework integrates three core elements:

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** This includes both your infrastructure costs (gas fees, validator expenses, cloud services) and personnel resources. The fluctuating nature of blockchain expenses makes this particularly challenging to predict.

**Target User Base:** Different market segments have distinct expectations and willingness to pay. Enterprise clients typically respond to value-based pricing focused on ROI, while native Web3 users may prioritize transparent transaction-based models.

**Key Value Propositions:** Clearly articulating how your solution addresses specific pain points allows you to establish pricing power based on perceived value rather than just costs.

Early-stage projects should prioritize user acquisition over immediate profitability. Misaligned or fluctuating prices create distrust within your community and lead to user churn—a particularly damaging outcome in the Web3 space where community is paramount.
