title: Avalanche L1s
description: Explore the multi-chain architecture of Avalanche ecosystem.
---

An Avalanche L1 is a sovereign network which defines its own rules regarding its membership and token economics. It is composed of a dynamic subset of Avalanche validators working together to achieve consensus on the state of one or more blockchains. Each blockchain is validated by exactly one Avalanche L1, while an Avalanche L1 can validate many blockchains.

Avalanche's [Primary Network](/docs/primary-network/overview) is a special Avalanche L1 running three blockchains:

- The Platform Chain [(P-Chain)](/docs/primary-network/overview#p-chain)
- The Contract Chain [(C-Chain)](/docs/primary-network/overview#c-chain)
- The Exchange Chain [(X-Chain)](/docs/primary-network/overview#x-chain)

<Callout title="Note">
Every validator of an Avalanche L1 **must** sync the P-Chain of the Primary Network for interoperability.
</Callout>

Node operators that validate an Avalanche L1 with multiple chains do not need to run multiple machines for validation. For example, the Primary Network is an Avalanche L1 with three coexisting chains, all of which can be validated by a single node, or a single machine.

## Advantages

### Independent Networks

- Avalanche L1s use virtual machines to specify their own execution logic, determine their own fee regime, maintain their own state, facilitate their own networking, and provide their own security.
- Each Avalanche L1's performance is isolated from other Avalanche L1s in the ecosystem, so increased usage on one Avalanche L1 won't affect another.
- Avalanche L1s can have their own token economics with their own native tokens, fee markets, and incentives determined by the Avalanche L1 deployer.
- One Avalanche L1 can host multiple blockchains with customized [virtual machines](/docs/avalanche-l1s/virtual-machines-overview).

### Native Interoperability

Avalanche Warp Messaging enables native cross-Avalanche L1 communication and allows Virtual Machine (VM) developers to implement arbitrary communication protocols between any two Avalanche L1s.

### Accommodate App-Specific Requirements

Different blockchain-based applications may require validators to have certain properties such as large amounts of RAM or CPU power.

an Avalanche L1 could require that validators meet certain [hardware requirements](/docs/primary-network/system-requirements#hardware-and-operating-systems) so that the application doesn't suffer from low performance due to slow validators.

### Launch Networks Designed With Compliance

Avalanche's L1 architecture makes regulatory compliance manageable. As mentioned above, an Avalanche L1 may require validators to meet a set of requirements.

Some examples of requirements the creators of an Avalanche L1 may choose include:

- Validators must be located in a given country.
- Validators must pass KYC/AML checks.
- Validators must hold a certain license.

### Control Privacy of On-Chain Data

Avalanche L1s are ideal for organizations interested in keeping their information private.

Institutions conscious of their stakeholders' privacy can create a private Avalanche L1 where the contents of the blockchains would be visible only to a set of pre-approved validators.

Define this at creation with a [single parameter](/docs/avalanche-l1s/evm-configuration/avalanche-l1-configs#private-avalanche-l1).

### Validator Sovereignty

In a heterogeneous network of blockchains, some validators will not want to validate certain blockchains because they simply have no interest in those blockchains.

The Avalanche L1 model enables validators to concern themselves only with blockchain networks they choose to participate in. This greatly reduces the computational burden on validators.

## Getting Started

As you begin your Avalanche L1 journey, it's useful to look at the lifecycle of taking an Avalanche L1 from idea to production.

### Figure Out Your Needs

The first step of planning your Avalanche L1 is determining your application's needs. What features do you need that the Avalanche C-Chain doesn't provide? 

#### When to Choose an Avalanche L1

Building your own Avalanche L1 is a great choice when your project demands capabilities beyond those offered by the C-Chain. For instance, if you need the flexibility to use a custom gas token, require strict access control (for example, by only permitting users who are KYC-verified), or wish to implement a unique transaction fee model, then an Avalanche L1 can provide the necessary options. In addition, if having a completely sovereign network with its own governance and consensus mechanisms is central to your vision, an Avalanche L1 is likely the best path forward.

#### Decide What Type of Avalanche L1 You Want

After confirming that an Avalanche L1 suits your project's requirements, the next step is to select the type of virtual machine (VM) that will power your blockchain. Broadly, you can choose among three options.

##### EVM-Based Avalanche L1s

The majority of Avalanche L1s are utilizing the Ethereum Virtual Machine. They support Solidity smart contracts and standard [Ethereum APIs](/docs/apis/c-chain/api#ethereum-apis). Ava Labs' implementation, [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm), is the most mature option available. It is recognized for its robust developer tooling and regular updates, making it the safest and most popular choice for building your blockchain.

##### Custom Avalanche L1s

Custom Avalanche L1s offer an open-ended interface that enables you to build any virtual machine you envision. Whether you fork an existing VM such as Subnet-EVM, integrate a non-Avalanche-native VM like Solana's, or build a completely new VM using any programming language you prefer, the choice is yours. For guidance on how to get started with VM development, see [Introduction to VMs](/docs/avalanche-l1s/virtual-machines).

#### Determine Tokenomics

Avalanche L1s are powered by gas tokens, and building your own blockchain gives you the flexibility to determine which token to use and how to distribute it. Whether you decide to leverage AVAX, adapt an existing C-Chain token, or launch a new token entirely, you'll need to plan the allocation of tokens for validator rewards, establish an emission schedule, and decide whether transaction fees should be burned or redistributed as block rewards.

#### Decide how to Customize Your Avalanche L1

Once you have selected your virtual machine, further customization may be necessary to align the blockchain with your specific needs. This might involve configuring the token allocation in the genesis block, setting gas fee rates, or making changes to the VM's behavior through precompiles. Such customizations often require careful iterative testing to perfect. For detailed instructions, refer to [Customize Your EVM-Powered Avalanche L1](/docs/avalanche-l1s/upgrade/customize-avalanche-l1).

#### Available Subnet-EVM Precompiles

The Subnet-EVM provides several precompiled contracts that you can use in your Avalanche L1 blockchain:

- [AllowList Interface](/docs/avalanche-l1s/evm-configuration/allowlist) - A reusable interface for permission management
- [Permissions](/docs/avalanche-l1s/evm-configuration/permissions) - Control contract deployment and transaction submission
- [Tokenomics](/docs/avalanche-l1s/evm-configuration/tokenomics) - Manage native token supply and minting
- [Transaction Fees & Validator Rewards](/docs/avalanche-l1s/evm-configuration/transaction-fees) - Configure fee parameters and reward mechanisms
- [Warp Messenger](/docs/avalanche-l1s/evm-configuration/warpmessenger) - Perform cross-chain operations

## Develop Your Own Avalanche L1

Avalanche L1s on Avalanche are deployed by default with [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm#subnet-evm), a fork of go-ethereum. It implements the Ethereum Virtual Machine and supports Solidity smart contracts as well as most other Ethereum client functionality.
