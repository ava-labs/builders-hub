## Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

- Verify the allowlist precompiles are active again (the tools no longer show “not available”).
- Confirm your wallet is an admin for both allowlists (per your `upgrade.json` config).
- Test basic functionality: sending a transaction and deploying a contract.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

- Restarted your Docker validator after appending the re-activation entries to `upgrade.json`.
- Waited long enough for the activation timestamps to pass (a block after each timestamp must be accepted).
- Core Wallet connected to your custom L1.

## Instructions

import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';
import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/toolbox/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx";
import DeployerAllowlist from "@/components/toolbox/console/l1-access-restrictions/DeployerAllowlist";
import TransactionAllowlist from "@/components/toolbox/console/l1-access-restrictions/TransactionAllowlist";
import DeployICMDemo from "@/components/toolbox/console/icm/test-connection/DeployICMDemo";

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Step 1: Confirm the precompiles are active (UI should be available)

    Open both tools while connected to your custom L1:

    <ToolboxMdxWrapper>
      <TransactionAllowlist />
    </ToolboxMdxWrapper>

    <ToolboxMdxWrapper>
      <DeployerAllowlist />
    </ToolboxMdxWrapper>

    **Expected Result**: you should see the full allowlist UI (not the “not available / not activated” state).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 2: Confirm your wallet is an Admin

    In each tool:

    1. Select `readAllowList`
    2. Paste your wallet address
    3. Execute/read

    **Expected Result**: your role should reflect **Admin** (because you added your address to `adminAddresses` in `upgrade.json` for both precompiles).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 3: Test you can transact and deploy again

    **Transaction test (Core Wallet)**:
    - In Core Wallet (connected to your custom L1), attempt to send a small amount of native token to another address.
    - The transaction should succeed once the Transaction Allowlist is active and your address is authorized.

    **Deployment test (Builder Console)**:

    <ToolboxMdxWrapper>
      <DeployICMDemo />
    </ToolboxMdxWrapper>

    Click “Deploy ICMDemo” and confirm the transaction in Core Wallet.

    <Callout type="info">
    If sending or deploying still fails, use the allowlist tools to explicitly `setEnabled` for your wallet address (or confirm your admin role is correctly set and the activation timestamp has passed).
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expected Output

- The allowlist tools render normally (no “not available” state).
- Your wallet reads as Admin in both tools.
- Sending a transaction and deploying a contract succeed.

## Verification

To verify you've completed this exercise successfully:

1. `TransactionAllowlist` and `DeployerAllowlist` load normally on your L1.
2. `readAllowList` reports your wallet as Admin for both.
3. You can send a transaction and deploy a contract again.

## Next Steps

Now that you can toggle these precompiles off and on via upgrades, you can apply the same upgrade pattern to other Subnet-EVM precompiles (fee manager, native minter, etc.) using the same `upgrade.json` mechanism.
