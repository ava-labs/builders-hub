# Native to ERC-20 Token Bridge

In this section, you'll learn how to export your L1's **native token** to the C-Chain, where it becomes an **ERC-20 token** that anyone can trade and use.

## The Problem

You've created an L1 with a custom native token (let's call it **TEST**). Your users want to:

- Trade TEST on C-Chain DEXs
- Use TEST in C-Chain DeFi protocols
- Bridge TEST to other Avalanche L1s

## The Solution

Deploy a **Native → ERC-20** bridge:

```
Your L1 (TEST is native)              C-Chain
┌──────────────────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────────────────┐
│                              │     │                              │
│  TEST (Native Gas Token)     │     │  TEST (ERC-20)               │
│       ↓                      │     │       ↑                      │
│  NativeTokenHome  ───────────│─────│  ERC20TokenRemote            │
│  (wraps & locks TEST)        │ ICM │  (mints ERC-20 TEST)         │
│                              │     │                              │
└──────────────────────────────┘     └──────────────────────────────┘
```

## Contracts Involved

| Contract | Chain | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **NativeTokenHome** | Your L1 | Wraps native TEST to WTEST, locks when bridging out |
| **ERC20TokenRemote** | C-Chain | Mints ERC-20 TEST when receiving bridge messages |
| **Wrapped Token (WTEST)** | Your L1 | ERC-20 wrapper for your native token |

## Key Difference from Other Chapters

| | Chapter 1 (ERC-20 → Native) | **Chapter 2 (Native → ERC-20)** | Chapter 3 (Native → Native) |
|--|--|--|--|
| **Direction** | Import to L1 | Export from L1 | Import to L1 |
| **Source** | ERC-20 on C-Chain | Native on L1 | Native on C-Chain |
| **Result** | Native gas token | ERC-20 on C-Chain | Native gas token |
| **Native Minter** | Required on L1 | Not required | Required on L1 |

## Prerequisites

For this chapter, you need:

1. **An existing L1** with a custom native token (or create one in this chapter)
2. **A wrapped version** of your native token (WTEST)
3. **A relayer** running between your L1 and C-Chain

<Callout type="info">
Unlike Chapters 1 and 3, this chapter does **not** require the Native Minter precompile since we're minting ERC-20 tokens, not native tokens.
</Callout>

## Deployment Flow

| Step | Action | Chain |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Create L1 with custom native token (or use existing) | Fuji (P-Chain) |
| 2 | Deploy Wrapped Token (WTEST) | Your L1 |
| 3 | Set up relayer | Local (Docker) |
| 4 | Deploy NativeTokenHome | Your L1 |
| 5 | Deploy ERC20TokenRemote | C-Chain |
| 6 | Register the remote | C-Chain → Your L1 |
| 7 | Bridge TEST → ERC-20 | Your L1 → C-Chain |

## What You'll Achieve

By the end of this section:

- ✅ Your L1's native token is available as an **ERC-20 on C-Chain**
- ✅ Users can bridge TEST from your L1 to C-Chain
- ✅ TEST can be traded on C-Chain DEXs and used in DeFi

Let's get started!
