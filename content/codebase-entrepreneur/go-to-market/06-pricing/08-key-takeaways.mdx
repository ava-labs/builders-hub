- Begin with transparent pricing that prioritizes user acquisition and community trust
- Implement a hybrid pricing model that combines fixed and usage-based components
- Use monitoring tools to track both variable costs (gas fees, validator costs) and fixed costs (personnel, hardware)
- Adapt your approach for different regions and client types without sacrificing consistency
- For enterprise clients, focus on value-based conversations rather than unit costs
