In permissioned or semi-permissioned environments, “open access” is often not acceptable. Organizations may need to control **who can submit transactions** (“transactors”) and **who can deploy contracts** (“deployers”) for operational risk management and compliance.

Here are common use-cases (non-exhaustive):

- **KYC / AML gating**: Only onboarded entities can transact or deploy contracts.
- **Consortium networks**: A set of known participants (banks, enterprises, or agencies) share a network; membership changes over time.
- **Staged rollouts**: Start with restricted access during pilot phases, then broaden access once monitoring and incident response are mature.
- **Reducing exploit surface**: Limiting deployers reduces the risk of malicious contract deployments; limiting transactors mitigates spam and abuse.
- **Operational controls**: Restrict privileged actions to approved operators (e.g., deployments via CI/CD wallets) and separate duties between teams.
- **Regulatory requirements**: Some businesses must prove control over participants, auditability of access changes, and governance over who can run what.
