<Step>

### Download Core Wallet

If you don't have Core Wallet installed already, click the `Download Core Wallet` button above.

Core is the only wallet that supports issuing P-Chain transactions, so it is not possible to use
other wallets such as MetaMask or Rabby.

<Step>

### Connect Core

Once Core is set up, refresh this page and click the `Connect Wallet` button above.

### Claim Testnet AVAX from the Faucet

Copy the coupon code:

```
avalanche-academy
```

Now head to the [Avalanche Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) and claim
some AVAX tokens on the C-Chain of the Fuji testnet. Enter the coupon code in the according field.

</Step>
<Step>

### Bridge AVAX to the P-Chain

Next, we need to transfer the AVAX you've just claimed from the Faucet on the C-Chain to the
P-Chain. Click the arrow pointing from the C-Chain to the P-Chain above. Enter `0.9 AVAX` and click
the `Export from C-Chain` button. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed and once the UTXO is
showing in the Exported UTXOs list, click the `Import to P-Chain` button.

</Step>
</Steps>

Congratulations! You have successfully set up your Core wallet and bridged some AVAX to the P-Chain.
