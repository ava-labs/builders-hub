# Native to Native Token Bridge

In this section, you'll learn how to bridge **native AVAX** from Fuji C-Chain to your own L1, where it becomes the **native gas token**.

## Use Case

This bridge type is ideal when:

- You want to use **AVAX** as your chain's gas currency
- You're building a chain that's part of the **Avalanche ecosystem**
- You need **shared security** via AVAX staking value

## Architecture Overview

```
Source Chain (Fuji C-Chain)                 Destination Chain (Your L1)
┌──────────────────────────────┐           ┌──────────────────────────────┐
│                              │           │                              │
│  AVAX (Native) → WAVAX       │           │  Native Token (minted AVAX)  │
│       ↓                      │           │       ↑                      │
│  NativeTokenHome  ───────────│───────────│  NativeTokenRemote           │
│  (wraps & locks AVAX)        │    ICM    │  (calls Native Minter)       │
│                              │           │                              │
└──────────────────────────────┘           └──────────────────────────────┘
```

## Contracts Involved

| Contract | Chain | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **NativeTokenHome** | Fuji C-Chain | Wraps AVAX to WAVAX, locks when bridging out, releases when bridging back |
| **NativeTokenRemote** | Your L1 | Calls Native Minter to create native tokens |
| **Native Minter Precompile** | Your L1 | System contract that mints native tokens |
| **WAVAX** | Fuji C-Chain | ERC-20 wrapper for native AVAX |

## Key Difference from Chapter 1

| | ERC-20 → Native (Chapter 1) | Native → Native (Chapter 2) |
|--|--|--|
| **Source Token** | USDC (ERC-20) | AVAX (Native) |
| **Home Contract** | ERC20TokenHome | NativeTokenHome |
| **Wrapping** | Not needed | AVAX wraps to WAVAX |
| **Use Case** | Stablecoin gas token | AVAX-based ecosystem |

## WAVAX (Wrapped AVAX)

Since native AVAX isn't an ERC-20 token, NativeTokenHome uses **WAVAX** internally:

1. User sends **AVAX** to NativeTokenHome
2. Contract **wraps** AVAX to WAVAX
3. WAVAX is **locked** in the contract
4. Bridge message is sent via ICM
5. On your L1, **native tokens are minted**

<Callout type="info">
Fuji C-Chain already has a deployed WAVAX contract. The toolbox will automatically detect and use it.
</Callout>

## Deployment Flow

Here's what we'll build:

| Step | Action | Chain |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Create L1 with Native Minter | Fuji (P-Chain) |
| 2 | Set up relayer | Local (Docker) |
| 3 | Deploy NativeTokenHome | Fuji C-Chain |
| 4 | Deploy NativeTokenRemote | Your L1 |
| 5 | Register + Collateralize | Your L1 → Fuji |
| 6 | Bridge AVAX → Native | Fuji → Your L1 |

## What You'll Achieve

By the end of this section:

- ✅ Your L1 uses **AVAX as the native gas token**
- ✅ Users can bridge AVAX from Fuji to get native tokens for gas
- ✅ The bridge is fully collateralized and secure

<Callout type="info">
**Token Backing**: Every native token minted on your L1 is backed 1:1 by WAVAX (wrapped AVAX) locked in the NativeTokenHome contract on Fuji.
</Callout>

Let's get started by creating your L1!
