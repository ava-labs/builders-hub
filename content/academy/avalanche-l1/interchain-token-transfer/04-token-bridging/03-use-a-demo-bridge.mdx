This guide will walk you through the process of using a bridge between 2 Avalanche blockchains, providing a step-by-step approach to ensure a smooth and secure experience.

Go to [ohmywarp.com](https://ohmywarp.com) and connect any web3 [wallet](https://core.app). Make sure your wallet has at least some AVAX on the Fuji Testnet. 

**Getting testnet AVAX:**
- **Recommended:** Create a [Builder Hub account](https://build.avax.network/login) and connect your wallet to receive testnet AVAX automatically
- **Alternative:** Use the [external faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) with coupon code `avalanche-academy`

Mint some `TLP` token on `C-Chain` in the Mint tab. This is an ERC20 deployed on Fuji's C-chain.
Finally bridge some `TLP` to `Dispatch`. You can confirm the transfer in the Mint tab.
