## Selling During the MVP Stage

### Leveraging Your Network

The foundation of early sales is your network. Map everyone in a similar position to how you identified the problem initially. Maintain industry contacts, especially if you previously worked in the sector you're targeting.

Keep your connections informed about your vision from the earliest stages. This continuous relationship-building creates a pool of potential early adopters who feel invested in both your product and your personal journey as a founder.

### Positioning Early Customers as Partners

<div style={{ margin: '2rem 0' }}>

</div>

When approaching first customers, frame the relationship as a partnership rather than a traditional vendor-client dynamic. Be transparent about your product's developmental stage—don't overpromise perfection.

<blockquote className="quote-card">
  <p>"Treat your first customers more as partners in your journey than as customers. Be clear and transparent with your first customers that this is a new product, and they are the first to try out something very exciting and innovative that's new to the world."</p>
  <cite>— Zoe Leavitt, Co-Founder at glass.fun</cite>
</blockquote>

Large enterprises requiring flawless execution from day one rarely make good first customers for startups. Instead, seek organizations willing to grow with you, provide feedback, and help shape your product's evolution.

Consider formalizing this collaborative approach through:
- Customer advisory boards with quarterly meetings
- Monthly feedback sessions
- Early referral or affiliate partnerships

These structures give early adopters a stake in your success while providing you with valuable insights for product development.
