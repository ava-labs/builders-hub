## Congratulations!

You have completed the **Streaming Asynchronous Execution** course. You now understand one of the most significant architectural advancements coming to Avalanche.

## What You Learned

Throughout this course, you explored:

### Execution Models
- The difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution
- How traditional blockchains couple consensus and execution
- Why decoupling enables better performance

### Block Lifecycle Under SAE
- How blocks are proposed without execution
- The FIFO execution queue and acceptance process
- How the block executor processes transactions
- Settlement timing and the tau delay

### Gas Mechanics
- Gas pricing fundamentals (T, M, K, R)
- The gas charged formula and lambda parameter
- Worst-case validity guarantees
- Queue DoS protection mechanisms

### Practical Implications
- API behavior changes and named blocks
- dApp optimization strategies
- Advanced use cases (HFT DeFi, custodial platforms)
- Future features enabled by SAE (VRF, encrypted mempool)

## Key Takeaways

| Concept | Key Point |
|---------|-----------|
| Decoupling | Consensus and execution run in parallel |
| Worst-Case Validity | Accepted transactions are guaranteed to settle |
| Gas Charged | $g_C = \max(g_U, g_L/\lambda)$ |
| Settlement Delay | $\tau$ = 5 seconds for C-Chain |
| Queue Limits | $\omega_Q = 2 \cdot \omega_B$ |
| Max DoS Impact | ~12% fee increase |

## Next Steps

Now that you understand SAE, consider:

1. **Stay Updated**: Follow the [ACP-194 Discussion](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/discussions/196) for implementation updates

2. **Prepare Your dApps**: Review your gas limit strategies and user experience flows

3. **Explore Related Topics**:
   - [Avalanche Consensus](/academy/avalanche-l1/avalanche-fundamentals/02-avalanche-consensus-intro/01-avalanche-consensus-intro)
   - [ACP-194 Full Specification](/docs/acps/194-streaming-asynchronous-execution)

4. **Share Your Knowledge**: Help other developers understand SAE
