This chapters covers the end-to-end validator lifecycle on a permissioned L1 managed by the `ValidatorManager` contract. For this, we will learn all of the operations available, understand the theory and demo it using the [Toolbox](https://build.avax.network/tools/l1-toolbox):

- Add a validator (initiate on L1, register on P-Chain, complete on L1)
- Change validator weight (churn-aware updates)
- Remove a validator (initiate on L1, remove on P-Chain, complete on L1)
- Disable on P-Chain for emergency/operational purposes

In order to fully understand these operations, it is a good reminder to see this diagram again, from the [ICM for Validator Manager Contracts](/academy/permissioned-l1s/01-introduction/02-interop), as we will dive deep into why and how these communication flows actually work/

## Key Concept Reminder

The **P-Chain** serves as the **single source of truth for all validator** operations across the Avalanche network. While your Validator Manager contract initiates operations and tracks state changes, the P-Chain ultimately determines which validators are active and recognized by the network.
