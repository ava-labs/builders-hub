## Overview

Wormhole is one of the most widely adopted interoperability platforms in blockchain, enabling secure cross-chain messaging, native token transfers, and multichain applications across 30+ blockchain networks. As a generic message passing protocol, Wormhole allows developers to build applications that seamlessly interact with multiple blockchains simultaneously, unlocking liquidity and users across the entire Web3 ecosystem.

With billions of dollars in cross-chain value transferred and integrations with major DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, and blockchain infrastructure, Wormhole has established itself as critical infrastructure for the multichain future. The platform's permissionless, decentralized architecture ensures that any developer can build cross-chain applications without needing permission or relying on centralized intermediaries.

## Features

- **Native Token Transfers**: Bridge tokens natively without wrapped intermediaries using Wormhole's Native Token Transfers (NTT).
- **Cross-Chain Queries**: Read state from any connected blockchain.
- **Permissionless Protocol**: Anyone can build on Wormhole without permission.
- **Decentralized Network**: Secured by 19 independent Guardian nodes including leading validators.
- **Wormhole Connect**: Pre-built UI widget for easy integration of bridging functionality.

- **Composability**: Build complex multichain applications with programmable cross-chain calls.

## Core Capabilities

### Generic Message Passing

Wormhole's core capability is passing arbitrary messages between blockchains:

**Arbitrary Data**: Send any data structure between chains, not just token transfers.

**Smart Contract Calls**: Trigger smart contract functions on destination chains.

**Cross-Chain Composability**: Build applications that compose functionality across multiple chains.

**State Synchronization**: Keep state synchronized across multiple blockchain deployments.

**Event Broadcasting**: Broadcast events from one chain to multiple chains.

This generic messaging enables entirely new categories of cross-chain applications.

### Native Token Transfers (NTT)

Wormhole's Native Token Transfers represent the next evolution in bridging:

**No Wrapped Tokens**: Transfer native tokens without wrapped intermediaries.

**Unified Liquidity**: Same native token across all chains.

**Custom Token Programs**: Flexible framework for different token designs.

**Rate Limiting**: Built-in security features like rate limits and transfer delays.

**Ownership Control**: Token issuers maintain control across all chains.

NTT eliminates fragmentation caused by wrapped token standards.

### Wormhole Connect

**Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on mobile devices.

Connect makes cross-chain integration accessible to any developer.

## Avalanche Integration

Wormhole fully supports Avalanche C-Chain with deep integration:

**Native Avalanche Support**: Direct integration with Avalanche consensus and finality.

**AVAX Bridging**: Bridge AVAX between Avalanche and 30+ other chains.

**Token Bridges**: Bridge any Avalanche token to other ecosystems.

**DeFi Integration**: Leverage Avalanche DeFi from other chains.

**Low Fees**: Benefit from Avalanche's low transaction costs.

**Fast Finality**: Quick bridging thanks to Avalanche's sub-second finality.

Wormhole enables Avalanche to connect to the broader multichain ecosystem.
