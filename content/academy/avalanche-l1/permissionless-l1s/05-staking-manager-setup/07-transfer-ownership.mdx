## Why Transfer Ownership?

Transfer ownership of the **Validator Manager contract** from your EOA (Externally Owned Account) to the `NativeTokenStakingManager` contract.

Currently, the Validator Manager contract is owned by your wallet address. This means only you can call functions with the `onlyOwner` modifier, such as:
- Adding validators to the network
- Removing validators from the network
- Managing validator weights

By transferring ownership to the `NativeTokenStakingManager` contract, these functions become **permissionless**—anyone can call them through the Staking Manager's public functions, enabling:
- **Permissionless validator registration**: Anyone can stake tokens and become a validator
- **Permissionless delegation**: Anyone can delegate to existing validators
- **Automated validator management**: The Staking Manager handles all validator operations based on staking logic

## Transfer Ownership

<Callout type="warn">
This is a one-time, irreversible operation. Once ownership is transferred, your EOA will no longer have direct control over validator operations. Ensure the Staking Manager address is correct before proceeding.
</Callout>
