**Automated Faucet:** Once you connect your wallet with a Builder Hub account, testnet tokens are automatically sent to your wallet when needed. You can also manually request tokens using the buttons above.

## Alternative Faucet

If you don't want to create a [Builder Hub Account](https://build.avax.network/login), you can use the external [Avalanche Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) with coupon code `avalanche-academy` or `avalanche-academy25` to get 2 AVAX on the C-Chain.

After you have claimed some AVAX on the C-Chain, you can bridge it to the P-Chain using this tool:
