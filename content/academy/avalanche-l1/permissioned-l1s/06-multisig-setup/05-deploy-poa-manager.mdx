import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';
import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/toolbox/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx";
import DeployPoAManager from "@/components/toolbox/console/permissioned-l1s/multisig-setup/DeployPoAManager.tsx";

Now that you have your Safe/Ash wallet set up, it's time to deploy the PoA Manager contract. This contract will act as the intermediary between your multi-sig and the Validator Manager.

## What the PoA Manager Does

The PoA Manager is initialized with two key addresses:

1. **Owner**: Your Safe/Ash multi-sig wallet address
2. **Validator Manager**: The VMC address on C-Chain (from the previous section)

```solidity
constructor(address _owner, address _validatorManager) {
    _transferOwnership(_owner);
    validatorManager = IValidatorManager(_validatorManager);
}
```

## Deployment Architecture

After this deployment, you'll have:

<Mermaid
  chart="
graph LR
    subgraph CChain [C-Chain]
        Safe[Safe/Ash Wallet]
        PoA[PoA Manager]
        VM[Validator Manager]
    end
    
    Safe -->|owns| PoA
    PoA -->|will own| VM
    
    subgraph PChain [P-Chain]
        Validators[Validator Registry]
    end
    
    VM -->|manages| Validators

    style PoA fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#d97706
    style VM fill:#d1fae5,stroke:#059669
"
/>

<Callout type="info">
**Note**: After deployment, the PoA Manager will be owned by your Safe wallet, but it won't own the Validator Manager yet. That ownership transfer happens in the next step.
</Callout>

## Deploy the Contract

Use the tool below to deploy your PoA Manager. You'll need:

- **Safe Address**: Your Ash/Safe wallet address from the previous section
- **Subnet ID**: To identify your L1's Validator Manager

The tool will:
1. Automatically detect your Validator Manager address from the selected subnet
2. Deploy the PoA Manager with your Safe as the owner
3. Verify the deployment

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
    <DeployPoAManager />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- ✅ **Contract Deployed**: You have a valid PoA Manager address
- ✅ **Owner Set**: The `owner()` function returns your Safe address
- ✅ **Validator Manager Linked**: The `validatorManager()` function returns the correct VMC address

## Current Ownership State

At this point, the ownership chain looks like this:

```
Safe Wallet → owns → PoA Manager
Your EOA → owns → Validator Manager (still!)
```

We need one more step to complete the chain: transferring Validator Manager ownership to the PoA Manager.

## Next Steps

In the next section, you'll:
1. Transfer Validator Manager ownership to the PoA Manager
2. Complete the multi-sig governance setup

This will establish the full ownership chain:

```
Safe Wallet → owns → PoA Manager → owns → Validator Manager
```
