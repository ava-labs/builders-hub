## From Proof of Authority to Proof of Stake

Now that we've covered how Proof of Stake serves as a Sybil protection mechanism that enables permissionless participation in your L1, the next question is: How do we actually transform an existing permissioned L1 using [Proof of Authority](/academy/permissioned-l1s/proof-of-authority/proof-of-authority) into a permissionless L1 with Proof of Stake?

In the previous section on [staking token selection](/academy/permissionless-l1s/proof-of-stake/staking-token), we learned that your staking token can either be your native token or a separate ERC20 token. **For this course, we will focus on building a permissionless L1 where the native token is also the staking token**—the most common and straightforward implementation that creates unified token economics.

### 1. Opening Validator Management (From Permissioned L1s)

In the [Permissioned L1s course](/academy/permissioned-l1s), you learned about the [Validator Manager Contract](/academy/permissioned-l1s/proof-of-authority/validator-manager-contract)—specifically how PoA restricts validator control to a single owner address. The contract hierarchy showed us:

- **PoA Model**: Only the owner can call `initiateValidatorRegistration()`, `initiateValidatorRemoval()`, and `initiateValidatorWeightUpdate()`
- **Centralized Control**: One account (EOA or multi-sig) acts as the gatekeeper

To enable PoS, we need to **open these functions to the public**—but with economic requirements instead of permission requirements.

### 2. Adding Token Economics (From L1 Native Tokenomics)

In the [L1 Native Tokenomics course](/academy/l1-native-tokenomics), you learned about [custom native tokens](/academy/l1-native-tokenomics/custom-tokens/introduction) and that [native tokens and staking tokens can be different](/academy/l1-native-tokenomics/custom-tokens/native-vs-staking). You also explored the [Native Minter Precompile](/academy/l1-native-tokenomics/native-minter/introduction) for managing token supply.

Now we need to integrate these token economics with validator management to create the economic security model that defines PoS.

## The Transformation Requirements

To enable native token staking on your L1, you'll need to configure specific precompiles:

### Required: Native Minter Precompile

When using your native token for staking, the **Native Minter Precompile is mandatory**. It enables the minting of staking rewards for validators.

> **Note**: If you're using an ERC20 token for staking instead, you don't need the Native Minter—the ERC20 token just needs to be mintable.

### Recommended: Reward Manager Precompile

The **Reward Manager Precompile is optional but highly recommended**. It automates reward distribution based on validator performance and participation.

If you choose not to enable the Reward Manager, transaction fees will simply be burned rather than distributed as rewards.

## Next Steps

In the following sections, we'll explore why these precompiles are necessary and how to configure them for your permissionless L1.
