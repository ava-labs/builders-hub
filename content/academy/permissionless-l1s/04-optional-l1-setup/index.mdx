This optional section provides a practical, hands-on guide to setting up a base L1 with native token staking capabilities. While the previous sections covered the theoretical requirements, this section walks you through the actual deployment and configuration steps.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll learn how to:

- Choose where to deploy your Validator Manager Contract
- Create an L1 with Native Minter and Reward Manager precompiles enabled
- Deploy and configure the Validator Manager
- Initialize your validator set
- Test that everything works correctly

## Prerequisites

Before starting this section, you should have:

- Completed the [Transformation Requirements](/academy/permissionless-l1s/transformation-requirements/introduction) section
- A basic understanding of the Native Minter and Reward Manager precompiles
- Access to a development environment with the necessary tools installed

## Is This Section For You?

This section is **optional** because:

- You may already have an L1 set up from previous courses
- You might want to focus on understanding the concepts before implementing
- You could be planning to use a different setup approach

However, if you want hands-on practice deploying a permissionless L1, this section provides a complete walkthrough.
