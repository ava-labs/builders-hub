# Bridge Native Tokens as Gas Tokens

With your Native-to-Native bridge fully configured and **collateralized**, you can now bridge tokens that arrive as the destination chain’s **native gas token**.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Step 1: Connect to the source chain

For this chapter’s “full loop” test, switch your wallet to **your L1** (the chain where `NativeTokenRemote` is deployed).

<Callout type="info">
You need enough native tokens on your L1 to bridge **plus gas** on your L1.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Step 2: Bridge using the Console transfer tool

Use the **Token Transfer** tool below to initiate the cross-chain transfer. When it completes, the tool will show a **success message** (including transaction/message details).

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Bridge fully collateralized (from previous step)
2. Native tokens to bridge
3. Additional tokens for gas fees
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
  <TestSend />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Step 3: Switch to the destination chain and confirm your gas balance increased

Switch to **Fuji C-Chain** (destination) and confirm you received the bridged value (unlocked on the home side).

<Callout type="info">
This step is testing the “bridge back” direction (L1 → Fuji). Your `NativeTokenRemote` sends a message back to the `NativeTokenHome` on Fuji to release the backing value.
</Callout>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

You’ve now completed both native-token bridging patterns in this course.
