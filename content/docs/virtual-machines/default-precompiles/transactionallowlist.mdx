description: Learn how to use the Transaction Allowlist Precompile to control which addresses can submit transactions on your Avalanche L1 blockchain.
---

The Transaction Allowlist Precompile allows you to control which addresses have permission to submit transactions on your Avalanche L1 blockchain. This is useful for creating a permissioned network where only authorized addresses can perform transactions.

## Activating the Precompile

To activate this feature, you need to provide the `txAllowListConfig` in the genesis:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "txAllowListConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
    }
  }
}
```

By enabling this feature, you can define which addresses are allowed to submit transactions and manage these permissions over time.

## Interface and Address

The Transaction Allowlist precompile is located at address `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000002` and implements the following interface:

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

interface ITransactionAllowList {
  event RoleSet(uint256 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender, uint256 oldRole);

  // Set [addr] to have the admin role over the precompile contract.
  function setAdmin(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to be enabled on the precompile contract.
  function setEnabled(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to have the manager role over the precompile contract.
  function setManager(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to have no role for the precompile contract.
  function setNone(address addr) external;

  // Read the status of [addr].
  function readAllowList(address addr) external view returns (uint256 role);
}
```

The Transaction Allowlist precompile uses the [AllowList interface](/docs/virtual-machines/default-precompiles/allowlist) to manage permissions for transaction submission.

## Role Permissions

The precompile defines several roles with different permissions:

- **Admin (2)**: Can add or remove any role (Admin, Manager, Enabled, None)
- **Manager (3)**: Can add or remove Enabled addresses
- **Enabled (1)**: Can submit transactions
- **None (0)**: Cannot submit transactions

When an address has no role or is explicitly set to None (0), any transaction from that address will be rejected by the network.

## Implementation

You can find the implementation of the Transaction Allowlist precompile in the [subnet-evm repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/master/precompile/contracts/txallowlist/contract.go).
