The Native Minter Precompile allows you to mint additional native tokens beyond the initial supply on your Avalanche L1 blockchain.

## Activating the Precompile

In order to activate this feature, you will need to provide the `contractNativeMinterConfig` in the genesis:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "contractNativeMinterConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
    }
  }
}
```

By enabling this feature, you can define who has permission to mint new tokens and how minting is managed over time.

## Interface and Address

The Native Minter precompile is located at address `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001` and implements the following interface:

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

interface INativeMinter {
  event NativeCoinMinted(address indexed sender, address indexed recipient, uint256 amount);
  // Mint [amount] number of native coins and send to [addr]
  function mintNativeCoin(address addr, uint256 amount) external;

  // IAllowList
  event RoleSet(uint256 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender, uint256 oldRole);

  // Set [addr] to have the admin role over the precompile contract.
  function setAdmin(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to be enabled on the precompile contract.
  function setEnabled(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to have the manager role over the precompile contract.
  function setManager(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to have no role for the precompile contract.
  function setNone(address addr) external;

  // Read the status of [addr].
  function readAllowList(address addr) external view returns (uint256 role);
}
```

The Native Minter precompile uses the [AllowList interface](/docs/virtual-machines/default-precompiles/allowlist) to restrict access to its functionality.

## Implementation

You can find the implementation of the Native Minter precompile in the [subnet-evm repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/master/precompile/contracts/nativeminter/contract.go).
