# Bridge Native Tokens as Gas Tokens

With your Native-to-Native bridge fully configured and **collateralized**, you can now bridge tokens that arrive as the destination chain’s **native gas token**.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Step 1: Connect to the source chain

Switch your wallet to the **source chain** (for this course flow: **Fuji C-Chain**).

<Callout type="info">
You need enough native tokens to bridge **plus gas** on the source chain.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Step 2: Bridge using the Console transfer tool

Use the **Token Transfer** tool below to initiate the cross-chain transfer. When it completes, the tool will show a **success message** (including transaction/message details).

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Bridge fully collateralized (from previous step)
2. Native tokens to bridge
3. Additional tokens for gas fees
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <TestSend />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Step 3: Switch to the destination chain and confirm your gas balance increased

Switch to the **destination chain** and confirm your **native balance** increased.

<Callout type="info">
This is the key difference vs Native → ERC-20: the bridged tokens show up as the destination chain’s **native token**, so you can use them for gas immediately.
</Callout>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

You’ve now completed both native-token bridging patterns in this course.
