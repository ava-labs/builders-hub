Welcome to the Codebase Entrepreneur Academy — where you’ll learn what it takes to launch and grow a successful blockchain company. This academy is designed to deliver actionable guidance from proven experts who have built and scaled in the Web3 space, specifically on Avalanche. Our speakers are seasoned founders and Avalanche experts who offer hard-earned lessons, strategic insights, and practical frameworks that go far beyond surface-level advice. You will gain direct access to the kind of knowledge and mentorship rarely shared publicly — the real alpha that can make the difference between a stalled idea and a successful venture. If you're serious about launching a Web3 business, this is where your journey begins.

##Credentials

The Codebase Entrepreneur Academy offers a structured certification pathway designed to recognize your progress as you build. Complete the following levels to earn the listed credential: 

Level 1 covers modules 1–3 and grants the “Foundations of a Web3 Venture” certificate, 

Level 2 covers modules 4–6 and grants the “Web3 Go-To-Market Strategist” certificate 

Level 3 covers modules 7–8 and grants the “Web3 Community Architect” certificate

Level 4 covers modules 9–11 and grants the “Web3 Fundraising & Finance Pro” certificate 

After completing each level, we will award you with the named certificate. You can share this on LinkedIn or other social networks and add it to your resume to highlight your achievement. Upon successful completion of all four levels, you will be recognized as a Certified Codebase Entrepreneur Academy Graduate. You’ll receive a verified badge on your Avalanche Builder’s Hub profile—a signal to the ecosystem that you've acquired hands-on, practical knowledge to launch and grow a Web3 venture.
