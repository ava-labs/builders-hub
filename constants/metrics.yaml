      summary: Get metrics for EVM chains
      description: >-
        EVM chain metrics are available for all Avalanche L1s on _Mainnet_ and
        _Fuji_ (testnet). You can request metrics by EVM chain ID. See the
        `/chains` endpoint for all supported chains.


        All metrics are updated several times every hour. Each metric data point
        has a `value` and `timestamp` (Unix timestamp in seconds). All metric
        values include data within the duration of the associated timestamp plus
        the requested `timeInterval`. All timestamps are fixed to the hour. When
        requesting a timeInterval of **day**, **week**, or **month**, the
        timestamp will be 0:00 UTC of the day, Monday of the week, or first day
        of the month, respectively. The latest data point in any response may
        change on each update.


        ### Metrics


        <ins>activeAddresses</ins>: The number of distinct addresses seen within
        the selected `timeInterval` starting at the timestamp. Addresses counted
        are those that appear in the “from” and “to” fields of a transaction or
        ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155 transfer log event.


        <ins>activeSenders</ins>: This metric follows the same structure as
        activeAddresses, but instead only counts addresses that appear in the
        “from” field of the respective transaction or transfer log event.


        <ins>cumulativeTxCount</ins>: The cumulative transaction count from
        genesis up until 24 hours after the timestamp. This aggregation can be
        considered a “rolling sum” of the transaction count metric (txCount).
        Only `timeInterval=day` supported.


        <ins>cumulativeAddresses</ins>: The cumulative count of unique addresses
        from genesis up until 24 hours after the timestamp. Addresses counted
        are those that appear in the “from” and “to” fields of a transaction or
        ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155 transfer log event. Only `timeInterval=day`
        supported.


        <ins>cumulativeContracts</ins>: The cumulative count of contracts
        created from genesis up until the timestamp.  Contracts are counted by
        looking for the CREATE, CREATE2, and CREATE3 call types in all
        transaction traces (aka internal transactions). Only `timeInterval=day`
        supported.


        <ins>cumulativeDeployers</ins>: The cumulative count of unique contract
        deployers from genesis up until 24 hours after the timestamp. Deployers
        counted are those that appear in the “from” field of transaction traces
        with the CREATE, CREATE2, and CREATE3 call types. Only
        `timeInterval=day` supported.


        <ins>gasUsed</ins>: The amount of gas used by transactions within the
        requested timeInterval starting at the timestamp.


        <ins>txCount</ins>: The amount of transactions within the requested
        timeInterval starting at the timestamp.


        <ins>avgGps</ins>: The average Gas used Per Second (GPS) within the day
        beginning at the timestamp.  The average is calculated by taking the sum
        of gas used by all blocks within the day and dividing it by the time
        interval between the last block of the previous day and the last block
        of the day that begins at the timestamp.  Only `timeInterval=day`
        supported.


        <ins>maxGps</ins>: The max Gas used Per Second (GPS)  measured within
        the day beginning at the timestamp. Each GPS data point is calculated
        using the gas used in a single block divided by the time since the last
        block. Only `timeInterval=day` supported.


        <ins>avgTps</ins>: The average Transactions Per Second (TPS) within the
        day beginning at the timestamp. The average is calculated by taking the
        sum of transactions within the day and dividing it by the time interval
        between the last block of the previous day and the last block of the day
        that begins at the timestamp. Only `timeInterval=day` supported.


        <ins>maxTps</ins>: The max Transactions Per Second (TPS) measured within
        the day beginning at the timestamp. Each TPS data point is calculated by
        taking the number of transactions in a single block and dividing it by
        the time since the last block. Only `timeInterval=day` supported.


        <ins>avgGasPrice</ins>: The average gas price within the day beginning
        at the timestamp. The gas price used is the price reported in
        transaction receipts. Only `timeInterval=day` supported.


        <ins>maxGasPrice</ins>: The max gas price seen within the day beginning
        at the timestamp. The gas price used is the price reported in
        transaction receipts. Only `timeInterval=day` supported.


        <ins>feesPaid</ins>: The sum of transaction fees paid within the day
        beginning at the timestamp. The fee is calculated as the gas used
        multiplied by the gas price as reported in all transaction receipts.
        Only `timeInterval=day` supported.
