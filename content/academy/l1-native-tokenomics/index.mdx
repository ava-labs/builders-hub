Welcome to the **L1 Native Tokenomics** course! This course is designed to give you a deep understanding of how to create and manage native tokens on your own Avalanche L1 blockchain. 

By the end of this course, you will have practical skills in designing tokenomics, configuring native token allocation, and leveraging precompiles to create powerful token economies.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have completed the [Blockchain Fundamentals](/academy/blockchain-fundamentals) and [Avalanche Fundamentals](/academy/avalanche-fundamentals) courses of the [Avalanche Developers Academy](https://build.avax.network/academy#:~:text=Choose%20Your%20Learning%20Path) learning tree. 
ck out this [guide](/guides/what-is-a-blockchain) to review what a blockchain is.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

- **Understand Token Fundamentals**: Gain deep insights into what tokens are, their differences, and the implications of creating native tokens versus ERC20 tokens.
- **Master Native Token Creation**: Learn how to create custom native tokens and understand when you need them versus when ERC20 tokens are sufficient.
- **Leverage Precompiles**: Understand how to use the Native Minter and Fee Config Precompiles to create powerful tokenomics.
- **Configure Token Economics**: Master fee configurations for fast chains, slow chains, and understand how this impacts your native token's supply dynamics.
- **Design Token Distribution**: Create effective vesting schedules, bonding curves, and airdrop strategies for your native tokens.
- **Implement Governance**: Develop governance structures including DAOs and quadratic voting models for decentralized decision-making.

But before getting into all of this, let's take a moment to think about whether you actually need to create an L1 with it's own native token for you use-case.
