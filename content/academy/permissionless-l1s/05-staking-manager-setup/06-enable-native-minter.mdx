The Staking Manager needs permission to mint native tokens for distributing staking rewards.

## Why Enable Native Minter?

The `NativeTokenStakingManager` distributes rewards by minting new native tokens through the Native Minter precompile. To do this, the Staking Manager's address must be added as an **Enabled** address on the Native Minter.

<Callout type="warning">
Only addresses with **Manager** or **Admin** permissions on the Native Minter can enable other addresses.
</Callout>

## Enable the Staking Manager

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="l1">
    {/* Add Native Minter enable component here */}
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## Next Steps

After enabling the Native Minter, you'll transfer ownership of the Staking Manager to the final admin address.
