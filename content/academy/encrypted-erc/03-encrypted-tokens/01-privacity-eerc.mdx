In the previous section, we explored why privacy is a critical enabler for blockchain adoption in industries like finance, enterprise, and gaming.  
Now we will focus on **eERC (Encrypted ERC)**, Avalancheâ€™s encrypted token standard and see the exact kind of privacy it delivers on C-Chain **Mainnet**, **Fuji(Testnet)**, and **custom L1 deployments**.

---

## Encrypted Balances
- Balances are **fully encrypted** on-chain.  
- Only the token holder (and authorized auditor) can see the actual balance.  
- Prevents competitors, analysts, or malicious actors from tracking your holdings.

---

## Private Transaction Amounts
- Transfer amounts are encrypted and not visible on public explorers like SnowTrace.  
- Observers can see that a transfer occurred but not **how much** was sent.  
- Uses **zero-knowledge proofs** to validate transactions without revealing amounts.

---

## Auditor-Ready Privacy
- Built-in **Auditability Module** allows authorized parties to decrypt specific transactions.  
- Access can be **revoked or rotated** without redeploying the contract.  
- Enables compliance with financial regulations while maintaining user privacy.

---

## EVM Compatibility
- Works seamlessly on Avalanche C-Chain Mainnet, Fuji (Testnet), and custom L1s without protocol changes.  
- Fully compatible with existing EVM smart contract tooling.  
- Developers can integrate using the **EncryptedERC Repository**.

---

## Flexible Deployment Modes
- **Standalone Mode**: Fully private token from creation, with optional hidden total supply.  
- **Converter Mode**: Wraps an existing ERC-20 into an encrypted token, enabling private transfers while preserving the ability to unwrap it back to ERC-20.

---

## Example Use Cases

**Confidential DeFi**  
- Private yield farming, liquidity provision, and staking allocations.

**Enterprise Payments**  
- Payroll systems where salaries are encrypted but verifiable to auditors.  
- Supplier payments that conceal exact deal sizes.

**Private Asset Management**  
- Managing tokenized real-world assets without revealing portfolio composition.  
- In-game transactions in private gaming economies.

In the **next section**, we will compare **ERC-20 vs eERC** to see exactly how these standards differ in privacy, compliance, and deployment options.
