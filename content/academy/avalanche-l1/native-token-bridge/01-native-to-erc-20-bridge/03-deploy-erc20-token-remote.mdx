# Deploy ERC20TokenRemote

The `ERC20TokenRemote` contract is deployed on the destination chain. It mints ERC-20 tokens representing your bridged native tokens.

## Understanding ERC20TokenRemote

The ERC20TokenRemote contract:

- **Mints ERC-20 tokens** when native tokens are bridged from the source chain
- **Burns ERC-20 tokens** when users bridge back to the source chain
- **References the home contract** on the source chain for security
- **Is a full ERC-20 token** that can be used in DeFi, transfers, etc.

## Deployment Parameters

When deploying ERC20TokenRemote, you'll provide:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Teleporter Registry** | The ICM registry contract on this chain |
| **Teleporter Manager** | Address that can manage ICM settings |
| **Source Chain** | The blockchain where NativeTokenHome is deployed |
| **Token Home Address** | Your NativeTokenHome contract address |
| **Token Name** | Name for the bridged token (e.g., "Wrapped AVAX") |
| **Token Symbol** | Symbol for the bridged token (e.g., "WAVAX.e") |
| **Token Decimals** | Decimal precision (usually 18, auto-detected) |

<Steps>
<Step>
### Switch to Destination Chain

Switch your wallet to the **Echo** chain (or your destination chain). The toolbox detects the connected chain and configures appropriately.

<Callout type="info">
Make sure you have test tokens on Echo for gas fees. You can get them from the [Builder Hub faucet](https://build.avax.network/login).
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy ERC20TokenRemote

Use the Deploy ERC20 Token Remote tool below. The tool will:

1. Ask you to select the **source chain** (Fuji C-Chain)
2. Let you enter the **Token Home Address** (from the previous step)
3. Auto-fill token details from the home contract

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Connected your Core Wallet to Echo
2. Sufficient test ECH for gas fees
3. Your NativeTokenHome address from the previous step
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={173750}>
    <DeployERC20TokenRemote />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Verify Token Details

After entering the Token Home Address, the tool automatically fetches:

- **Token Name**: Derived from the source token
- **Token Symbol**: Derived from the source token  
- **Token Decimals**: Matches the source token

Verify these details are correct before deploying.

</Step>

<Step>
### Save the Remote Address

After deployment, save the **ERC20 Token Remote Address**. You'll need it for:

- Registering with the home contract
- Adding the token to your wallet
- Debugging transfer issues

</Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens During Deployment

When you deploy ERC20TokenRemote:

1. **Contract creation**: A new ERC-20 token contract is deployed
2. **Home reference stored**: The source chain ID and home address are saved
3. **Token metadata set**: Name, symbol, and decimals are configured
4. **Ready for registration**: The contract can now register with the home

## The Deployed Token

Your ERC20TokenRemote is a fully-featured ERC-20 token:

```solidity
// Standard ERC-20 functions are available
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
```

Users can:
- Transfer tokens to other addresses
- Approve tokens for DeFi protocols
- Use tokens in any ERC-20 compatible application

## Contract State After Deployment

After deployment, your ERC20TokenRemote:

- ✅ Is a valid ERC-20 token
- ✅ Knows which home contract to communicate with
- ❌ Is NOT registered with the home (transfers won't work yet)
- ❌ Has zero total supply (no tokens minted yet)

## Why Registration is Required

The home contract maintains a list of authorized remote contracts. Without registration:

- The home contract doesn't know this remote exists
- Token transfers will be rejected
- The bridge is not functional

## Next Steps

Now you need to **register the remote contract** with the home contract to complete the bridge setup.
