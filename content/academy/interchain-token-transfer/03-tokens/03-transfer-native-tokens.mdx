In this exercise, you will learn how to transfer native tokens (AVAX) between accounts using Core Wallet. We'll demonstrate this using the Fuji testnet.

<Steps>
<Step>

## Open Core Wallet

First, make sure you have Core Wallet installed. If you don't have Core Wallet installed already, click the Download Core Wallet button below.

</Step>
<Step>

## Get Test AVAX

Before transferring tokens, ensure you have some test AVAX:

Copy the coupon code:

```
avalanche-academy
```

Now head to the [Avalanche Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) and claim some AVAX tokens on the C-Chain of the Fuji testnet. Enter the coupon code in the according field.

</Step>
<Step>

## Transfer AVAX

To transfer AVAX to another address:

1. Click the "Send" button in Core Wallet
2. Enter the recipient's address
3. Enter the amount of AVAX to send
4. Review the transaction details
5. Click "Send" to confirm

</Step>
<Step>

## Verify the Transfer

To verify the transfer was successful:

1. Check the transaction status in Core Wallet
2. View the transaction details on the [Fuji Explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io)
3. The recipient can check their balance in their Core Wallet

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout>
Remember that you need to have enough AVAX in your wallet to cover both the transfer amount and the gas fees. Always double-check the recipient address before sending to avoid any loss of funds.

Now that you know how to transfer native tokens, you can proceed to learn about transferring ERC-20 tokens in the next section.
