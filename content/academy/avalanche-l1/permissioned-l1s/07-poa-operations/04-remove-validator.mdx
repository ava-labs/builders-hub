Removing a validator is a significant operation that permanently removes them from your L1's validator set. This guide covers the multi-sig process for safely removing validators.

## When to Remove a Validator

Common reasons for validator removal:

- **Decommissioning**: The validator is being permanently shut down
- **Performance Issues**: Persistent poor performance or downtime
- **Security Concerns**: Potential compromise or suspicious behavior
- **Governance Decisions**: Consortium membership changes
- **Resource Optimization**: Reducing the validator set size

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: Validator removal is permanent. The removed validator's node will no longer participate in consensus once the process completes.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- ✅ The validator must be in **Active** status
- ✅ Access to your Safe wallet with required signers
- ✅ The validator's **Validation ID**
- ✅ Consider the impact on your validator set's total weight

## Phase 1: Initiate Validator Removal

<Steps>
<Step>

### Identify the Validator

Get the **Validation ID** of the validator you want to remove:

- Use the [Query Validator Set tool](/academy/permissioned-l1s/05-validator-manager-operations/02-query-validator-set)
- Check your validator management records
- Reference previous transaction history

</Step>
<Step>

### Access Your Safe Wallet

1. Navigate to [wallet.ash.center](https://wallet.ash.center/)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Select your Safe
4. Go to **"New Transaction"** → **"Transaction Builder"**

</Step>
<Step>

### Configure the Transaction

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **To Address** | Your PoA Manager address |
| **Value** | 0 |
| **Contract Method** | `removeValidator` |

**Parameters:**
- **Validation ID**: The unique identifier of the validator to remove

</Step>
<Step>

### Review Carefully

Before submitting:

- ✅ Confirm the correct Validation ID
- ✅ Ensure you're not removing a critical validator
- ✅ Verify the remaining validator set has sufficient weight
- ✅ Communicate with stakeholders about the removal

</Step>
<Step>

### Submit and Collect Approvals

1. Submit the transaction
2. Share details with other signers
3. Wait for required approvals
4. Verify each signer understands what's being removed

</Step>
<Step>

### Execute the Transaction

Once threshold is reached:

1. Execute the transaction
2. Wait for confirmation
3. The validator status changes to **PendingRemoved**
4. A Warp message (weight = 0) is sent to P-Chain

</Step>
</Steps>

## Phase 2: Complete Validator Removal

<Steps>
<Step>

### Wait for P-Chain Processing

The P-Chain processes the removal and returns a signed confirmation with `valid = false`.

</Step>
<Step>

### Prepare Completion Transaction

In your Safe wallet:

1. Create a new transaction
2. Target your PoA Manager
3. Call `completeValidatorRemoval`
4. Provide the message index

</Step>
<Step>

### Collect Approvals and Execute

1. Submit the completion transaction
2. Collect signer approvals
3. Execute when threshold is reached

**Result**: The validator is permanently removed from the validator set.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Post-Removal Verification

After completing the removal:

1. **Query Validator Set**: Confirm the validator no longer appears
2. **Check Total Weight**: Verify the remaining weight is sufficient
3. **Monitor Network**: Ensure consensus continues smoothly
4. **Update Documentation**: Record the removal for audit purposes

## Impact Considerations

Before removing a validator, consider:

### Total Weight Threshold

Your validator set needs minimum weight for churn operations. Removing too much weight can impact:
- Future validator additions
- Weight changes for remaining validators

### Network Resilience

- **Small validator sets**: Removing validators may reduce fault tolerance
- **Large sets**: Impact is typically minimal

### Validator Balance Recovery

The removed validator's remaining P-Chain balance will be returned to the **Remaining Balance Owner** addresses specified during the original registration.

## Emergency Removal

In emergency situations where you can't wait for multi-sig approval, remember the [P-Chain Disable option](/academy/permissioned-l1s/05-validator-manager-operations/10-pchain-disable-validator):

- The **Disable Owner** can directly disable a validator on P-Chain
- This doesn't require multi-sig approval
- Weight still counts, but the validator is inactive
- Full removal still requires the multi-sig flow later

## Complete Removal Flow

## Chapter Summary

Congratulations! You've completed the multi-sig governance course. You now know how to:

- ✅ Deploy a Validator Manager on C-Chain
- ✅ Create and configure a Safe/Ash multi-sig wallet
- ✅ Deploy and configure a PoA Manager
- ✅ Transfer ownership through the governance chain
- ✅ Perform all validator operations with multi-sig approval

This multi-sig setup provides secure, auditable governance for your permissioned L1's validator set.
