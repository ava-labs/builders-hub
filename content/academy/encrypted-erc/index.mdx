Welcome to the **eERC Token Standard** course! This course is designed to give you a deep understanding of encrypted ERC (eERC), a privacy preserving ERC-20 like token standard developed by AvaCloud, enabling confidential transactions on EVM-compatible blockchains. By the end of this course, you will understand the privacy limitations of traditional token standards, how eERC solves them, and how to create and integrate your own private tokens.

## Course Content

### 1. What is a Digital Asset?
- **Standards**: ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155
- **Current Uses**: How companies, DeFi protocols, and projects are using them today.
- **Limitations**: Challenges companies face when trying to adopt these standards (scalability, privacy, compliance).

### 2. Real Privacy
- **How Private is the Blockchain?**: Transparency vs confidentiality.
- **Compliance**: Why regulatory alignment matters for privacy tokens.
- **Necessities Solved with Privacy**: Situations where privacy is essential (e.g., sensitive transactions, enterprise use).

### 3. Encrypted Tokens
- **What Kind of Privacy Does eERC Provide?**: Hidden balances, confidential transfers.
- **Comparison: ERC-20 vs eERC**: Feature-by-feature breakdown.
- **Technology Behind eERC**: Zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption.

### 4. Usability of eERC
- **Standalone vs Converter Contract**: When to use each mode.
- **Use Cases**: From DeFi to regulated financial institutions.

### 5. eERC Contracts Flow
- **Step-by-Step**: Creating your own eERC token and considerations.
- **Kinds of ZKProof to Use**: Selection criteria based on use case.
- **User Flow**: How to interact with eERC as an end user.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

### Blockchain Fundamentals
Familiarity with EVM-based blockchains and ERC token standards.

### Development Tools
Basic knowledge of Solidity and comfort using TypeScript will help, especially when working with the Privacy functions.
