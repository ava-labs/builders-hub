## Why Docker?

BuilderHub hosted nodes are convenient, but they don't allow direct access to configuration files. To perform **network upgrades** (like disabling/enabling precompiles), you need to:

1. Edit the `upgrade.json` file in the node's config directory
2. Restart the node to apply changes

This requires running your own validator with full access to the filesystem.

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: Your Docker validator will become the primary node for this exercise. Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your machine.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running
- Your **Blockchain ID** from the L1 you created earlier
- Your **Subnet ID** from the L1 you created earlier

## Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Step 1: Launch Docker Validator

    Use the tool below to run a self-hosted AvalancheGo node in Docker:

    <ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="testnet-mainnet">
      <AvalancheGoDocker />
    </ToolboxMdxWrapper>

    The tool will generate the Docker command with the correct configuration for your L1.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 2: Verify the Node is Running

    Check that your container is running:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

    You should see a container running AvalancheGo.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 3: Verify Bootstrap Status

    Open a shell inside your container:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it <YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID> sh
    ```

    Then check if your chain is bootstrapped:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST --data '{
      "jsonrpc":"2.0",
      "id":1,
      "method":"info.isBootstrapped",
      "params": {
        "chain":"YOUR_BLOCKCHAIN_ID"
      }
    }' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_BLOCKCHAIN_ID` with your L1's blockchain ID. You should see:

    ```json
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"isBootstrapped":true},"id":1}
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 4: Connect Core Wallet

    Add your L1's RPC to Core Wallet:

    - **RPC URL**: `http://localhost:9650/ext/bc/YOUR_BLOCKCHAIN_ID/rpc`
    - **Chain ID**: Your L1's chain ID

    Verify you can see your balance and send transactions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expected Output

You should have:

- A running Docker container with AvalancheGo
- Your L1 chain bootstrapped and producing blocks
- Core Wallet connected to your local node

## What You Can Now Do

With your own Docker validator, you can:

- Access the node's config directory at `~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/<BLOCKCHAIN_ID>/`
- Create and modify `upgrade.json` files
- Restart the node to apply network upgrades

## Next Steps

Now that your Docker validator is running, you'll learn the rules for creating network upgrades.
