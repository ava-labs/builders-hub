## Overview

Avalanche L1s ship multiple default precompiles that need access control. Rather than inventing a new permission model for each feature, many of them reuse the same audited permission interface: the **AllowList interface**.

This matters because once you understand **Admin / Manager / Enabled**, you can reason about (and safely operate) a large set of precompiles with the same mental model.

## The AllowList interface

The AllowList interface exposes a small set of functions to manage roles for addresses:

### Functions

- `setAdmin(address addr)`: give `addr` **Admin** role.
- `setManager(address addr)`: give `addr` **Manager** role.
- `setEnabled(address addr)`: give `addr` **Enabled** role.
- `setNone(address addr)`: remove any role from `addr` (back to **None**).
- `readAllowList(address addr) -> uint256`: read the current role value.

### Permission levels

The roles are:

- **Admin**: can manage all roles (Admin, Manager, Enabled).
- **Manager**: can manage Enabled addresses only.
- **Enabled**: can use the precompile’s functionality (what that means depends on the specific precompile).
- **None**: no access.

This is a *role-based access control* pattern, implemented consistently across precompiles that opt into it.

## Precompiles that use AllowList

Several default Avalanche L1 precompiles implement this interface (examples):

- [Deployer AllowList](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/deployer-allowlist)
- [Transaction AllowList](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/transaction-allowlist)
- [Native Minter](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/native-minter)
- [Fee Manager](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/fee-manager)
- [Reward Manager](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/reward-manager)

## Note on stateful precompiles

Many precompiles are **stateful** (they can read/write chain state at the VM layer). If you haven't seen this concept yet, review the [Stateful Precompiles](/academy/avalanche-l1/customizing-evm/09-stateful-precompiles) section in the [Customizing the EVM](/academy/avalanche-l1/customizing-evm) course.
