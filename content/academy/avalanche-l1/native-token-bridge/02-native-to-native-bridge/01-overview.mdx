# Native to Native Token Bridge

In this section, you'll learn how to bridge native tokens from a source chain to a destination chain, where they'll be received as **native tokens** (used for gas fees).

## Use Case

This bridge type is ideal when:

- You want your L1's native token to be **the gas token** on another chain
- You're building a **multi-chain ecosystem** with a shared native token
- You want **seamless gas fee payments** across chains without token swaps

## Key Difference from ERC-20 Bridge

| Aspect | Native → ERC-20 | Native → Native |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Destination token type** | ERC-20 | Native (gas token) |
| **Destination contract** | ERC20TokenRemote | NativeTokenRemote |
| **Requires Native Minter** | No | Yes |
| **Requires Collateral** | No | Yes |
| **Use for gas** | No (need to swap) | Yes (directly) |

## Architecture Overview

```
Source Chain (e.g., Fuji C-Chain)          Destination Chain (e.g., Custom L1)
┌──────────────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────────────┐
│                              │          │                              │
│  Native Token (AVAX)         │          │  Native Token (minted)       │
│       ↓                      │          │       ↑                      │
│  Wrapped Token (WAVAX)       │          │  Native Minter Precompile    │
│       ↓                      │    ICM   │       ↑                      │
│  NativeTokenHome   ──────────│────────▶ │  NativeTokenRemote           │
│                              │          │                              │
└──────────────────────────────┘          └──────────────────────────────┘

## Contracts and Components

| Component | Chain | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **WrappedNativeToken** | Source | ERC-20 wrapper for native tokens |
| **NativeTokenHome** | Source | Holds wrapped tokens, manages bridge state |
| **NativeTokenRemote** | Destination | Calls Native Minter to create native tokens |
| **Native Minter Precompile** | Destination | System contract that can mint native tokens |

## The Native Minter Precompile

The `NativeTokenRemote` contract requires the **Native Minter precompile** to be enabled on the destination chain. This precompile:

- Is a built-in Avalanche L1 feature
- Allows authorized contracts to mint native tokens
- Must be configured in the chain's genesis or via upgrade
- Address: `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001`

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: The Native Minter precompile is NOT enabled on standard chains like C-Chain. You need a custom L1 with this precompile activated.
</Callout>

## Collateral Requirement

Unlike ERC-20 bridging, Native Token bridging requires **collateral**:

### Why Collateral?

When NativeTokenRemote mints native tokens, it's creating real gas tokens. The protocol requires:

1. **Initial Reserve Imbalance**: Set during deployment
2. **Collateral Deposit**: Tokens deposited to back the minted supply
3. **Full Collateralization**: Required before minting is enabled

### Collateral Flow

```
1. Deploy NativeTokenRemote (set initial reserve imbalance)
2. Register with Home
3. Add collateral on source chain (NativeTokenHome)
4. Once collateralized, bridging is enabled
```

## Deployment Flow

Here's the complete process:

### Step 1: Deploy NativeTokenHome (Source Chain)

Same as Native → ERC-20 bridge. You may already have this deployed.

### Step 2: Deploy NativeTokenRemote (Destination Chain)

Deploy on a chain with Native Minter enabled. Configure:
- Initial reserve imbalance
- Burned fees reporting percentage

### Step 3: Register Remote with Home

Establish the secure connection between contracts.

### Step 4: Add Collateral

On the source chain, deposit tokens to fully collateralize the bridge.

### Step 5: Bridge Tokens

Once collateralized, users can bridge tokens that become native gas tokens.

## What You'll Build

In this section, we'll set up a native-to-native bridge:

| Step | Action | Chain |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Deploy/Use NativeTokenHome | Source (Fuji) |
| 2 | Deploy NativeTokenRemote | Destination (L1 with Native Minter) |
| 3 | Register Remote with Home | Destination |
| 4 | Add Collateral | Source |
| 5 | Bridge tokens | Source → Destination |

<Callout type="info">
If you already deployed NativeTokenHome in the previous section, you can reuse it! A single home contract can have multiple remote contracts registered.
</Callout>

Let's get started!
