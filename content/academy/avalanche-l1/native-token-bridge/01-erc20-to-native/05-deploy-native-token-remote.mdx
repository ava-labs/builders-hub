# Deploy NativeTokenRemote

The `NativeTokenRemote` contract is deployed on your L1. It calls the Native Minter precompile to create native tokens when USDC is bridged from Fuji.

## Understanding NativeTokenRemote

The NativeTokenRemote contract:

- **Calls the Native Minter** to mint native tokens when receiving bridge messages
- **Burns native tokens** when users bridge back to Fuji
- **Requires collateralization** before bridging is enabled
- **References the ERC20TokenHome** on Fuji for security

## Initial Reserve Imbalance

When deploying NativeTokenRemote, you set an **initial reserve imbalance**. This represents native tokens that already exist on your L1 (e.g., from genesis allocations) that aren't yet backed by locked USDC.

<Callout type="info">
If your L1 was just created with no pre-existing native tokens, you can set this to `0`.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### Switch to Your L1

Switch your wallet to the L1 you created earlier. Ensure you have native tokens for gas (from genesis allocation or faucet).

</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy NativeTokenRemote

Use the Deploy Native Token Remote tool below:

1. Select **Fuji C-Chain** as the source chain
2. Enter the **ERC20TokenHome address** from the previous step
3. Set the **initial reserve imbalance** (use `0` if no pre-existing supply)

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Connected your Core Wallet to your L1
2. Native tokens on your L1 for gas fees
3. Your ERC20TokenHome address from the previous step
</Callout>

    <DeployNativeTokenRemote />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Save the Contract Address

After deployment, save the **Native Token Remote Address**. You'll need it for registration and collateralization.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Contract State After Deployment

After deployment, your NativeTokenRemote:

- ✅ Is configured to call the Native Minter precompile
- ✅ Knows which ERC20TokenHome to communicate with
- ❌ Is NOT registered with the home (transfers won't work yet)
- ❌ Is NOT collateralized (minting is blocked)

## Next Steps

Now you need to **register the remote** and **add collateral** to enable bridging.
