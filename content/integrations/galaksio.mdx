## Overview

Galaksio is a pay-as-you-go cloud infrastructure layer that allows developers to execute scripts, run AI workloads, and store results using simple HTTP requests, with payments handled automatically in USDC via **HTTP 402 Payment Required** and the **x402 Protocol**.

It connects Web2-style developer workflows with decentralized infrastructure, running jobs on networks like Akash or E2B and storing results on Arweave, IPFS, or Filecoin, while abstracting wallets, gas, and on-chain complexity from end users.

## Features

- **HTTP-based Web3 resources**: Access compute and storage using standard HTTP calls.
- **Decentralized sandboxes**: Run scripts and AI jobs securely on Akash, E2B, or similar networks.
- **Permanent and ephemeral storage**: Store results on Arweave for permanence or IPFS/Filecoin for caching.
- **Pay-as-you-go USDC**: Pay only for what you use, settled automatically via HTTPayer.
- **GitHub integration**: Connect repositories and deploy workloads directly from GitHub.
- **Real-time analytics**: Monitor deployments, logs, and usage through detailed dashboards.
- **x402-native access control**: Services return HTTP 402 and are unlocked via on-chain payment flows.
- **GLUSD stablecoin**: A non-rebasing, yield-bearing stablecoin backed by real usage and x402 revenue.

## Use Cases

Galaksio supports a range of Avalanche-native developer workflows:

- **AI workloads**: Run inference, fine-tuning, or batch jobs without managing infrastructure.
- **Serverless compute**: Execute scripts on demand for automation, data processing, or integrations.
- **Decentralized storage pipelines**: Persist results, logs, or datasets in permanent or verifiable storage.
- **Agent tooling**: Provide AI agents with access to paid tools, compute, or data via HTTP.
- **Developer platforms**: Add programmable compute and storage primitives into apps and SDKs.

## How It Works

Galaksio uses a unified pay-as-you-go flow powered by HTTPayer:

1. **Service returns HTTP 402**  
   A compute or storage endpoint responds with HTTP 402 Payment Required.

2. **Payment handled automatically**  
   HTTPayer settles the required USDC payment on-chain using the x402 Protocol.

3. **Job executes securely**  
   The workload runs in a decentralized sandbox such as Akash or E2B.

4. **Results stored and accessible**  
   Outputs are stored on Arweave for permanence or IPFS/Filecoin for ephemeral access, with logs available in real time.

## Conclusion

Galaksio provides a bridge between traditional developer workflows and decentralized infrastructure, enabling programmable access to compute and storage using HTTP, USDC, and the x402 Protocol on Avalanche C-Chain.
