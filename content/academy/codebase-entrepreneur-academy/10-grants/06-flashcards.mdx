## Flashcards

**Foundation Grants vs. VC Funding**
- **Definition**: Unlike VCs seeking ROI, foundation grants prioritize ecosystem impact
- **Example**: A project creating open-source infrastructure that many can build upon

**Ecosystem Fit**
- **Definition**: How well your project addresses a specific gap or need in the Avalanche ecosystem
- **Example**: Building privacy solutions that enable real-world business transactions on Avalanche

**Proof of Shipping**
- **Definition**: Evidence that demonstrates your ability to execute and deliver on your roadmap
- **Example**: A working prototype on Fuji testnet that shows core functionality

**Grant Hunting**
- **Definition**: Applying for grants across multiple ecosystems without customization or commitment
- **Example**: Submitting identical proposals to Avalanche, Solana, and Ethereum without blockchain-specific considerations

**Business Development Support**
- **Definition**: Connections and introductions provided by the foundation to help your project grow
- **Example**: Getting introduced to institutional custodians that would be difficult to reach independently
