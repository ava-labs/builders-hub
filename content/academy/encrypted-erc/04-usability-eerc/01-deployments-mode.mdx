The **eERC** standard offers two deployment modes to fit different project needs: **Standalone Mode** and **Converter Mode**.  
Both deliver encrypted balances and private transfers, but they differ in how the token is created and used.

---

## Standalone Mode
- Token is **private from creation**, all balances and amounts are encrypted from the first mint.
- Uses **ElGamal encryption** over the **BabyJubJub** curve for privacy.
- Transaction proofs use **Poseidon hashing** for efficiency in zk-SNARKs.
- **Optional hidden total supply** to prevent public insight into circulation.
- Best suited for:
  - Enterprise payment systems.
  - Regulated financial assets with selective auditor access.
  - Private gaming economies on Avalanche L1s.

---

## Converter Mode
- Wraps an **existing ERC-20 token** into an encrypted form.
- Allows private transfers using the eERC format while preserving the option to unwrap back to the public ERC-20.
- Uses the same encryption and proof flow as Standalone Mode.
- Best suited for:
  - Adding privacy to an already deployed public token.
  - Hybrid systems where some transactions are public and others private.
  - Bridging between public liquidity pools and private markets.

In the **next section**, we will explore **Use Cases of eERC**, including examples from Avalanche C-Chain Mainnet, Fuji (Testnet), and custom L1 deployments, along with a step-by-step view of a private transfer flow.
