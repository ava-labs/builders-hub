For blockchain projects, cryptographic key management is fundamental to security. Follow these best practices:

1. **Follow established standards**: The Cryptocurrency Security Standard (currently version 9) provides comprehensive guidance for key material management.

2. **Keep private keys secure**:
   - Store keys offline when possible
   - Always encrypt private key material
   - Consider splitting keys into different shards
   - Use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for enhanced protection

3. **Implement strict admin privilege controls**:
   - No one should have admin rights by default
   - Use a "breaking glass" mechanism requiring approval from stakeholders for privilege escalation
   - Remember that risk = rights Ã— time (minimize both)
