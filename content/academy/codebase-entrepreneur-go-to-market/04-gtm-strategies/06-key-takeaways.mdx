- **Structured Approach:** Follow a systematic GTM framework that identifies target companies, defines personas, leverages networks, and builds replicable success stories.

- **Education Focus:** Be prepared to explain blockchain benefits in simple terms, addressing both curiosity and concerns about the technology.

- **Community Importance:** Developer communities often influence adoption decisions, making them a critical component of your GTM strategy.

- **Flexible Metrics:** Your success measurements should evolve with your business, potentially shifting from revenue to ecosystem growth metrics as you scale.

- **Realistic Timeframes:** Focus on achievable goals within 1-3 month periods, allowing for adaptation in a rapidly changing market.

- **Network Leverage:** Your founder connections and investment base can be powerful resources for early partnerships and client acquisition.

- **Web3 Advantage:** Recognize that Web3 partnerships can often close more quickly than traditional Web2 collaborations, but prepare for longer sales cycles with larger organizations.
