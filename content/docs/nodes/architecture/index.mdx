title: AvalancheGo Architecture
description: Understand the internal architecture and components of AvalancheGo, the official Avalanche node implementation.
---

AvalancheGo is the official Go implementation of an Avalanche node. It powers the Primary Network (P/C/X) and any Avalanche L1s you launch, delivering high throughput and sub-second probabilistic finality.

## What is AvalancheGo?

AvalancheGo is a full-node implementation that:

- **Validates transactions** across the Primary Network (P-Chain, C-Chain, X-Chain)
- **Participates in consensus** using Avalanche's Snow* family of protocols
- **Serves API requests** for wallets, dApps, and other clients
- **Supports Avalanche L1s** (blockchains validated by Subnets) for custom networks

<Callout type="info">
AvalancheGo is written in Go and is designed to be modular, allowing developers to build custom Virtual Machines (VMs) that define their own blockchain logic.
</Callout>

## Architecture at a Glance

- **Networking**: Custom P2P stack with mutual TLS (staking certs), throttling, peer scoring, and subnet-aware gossip.
- **Consensus engines**: Snowman/Snowman++ for all Primary Network chains (P/C/X post-Cortina). The legacy Avalanche DAG engine exists but is unused.
- **VMs**: PlatformVM (P-Chain), Coreth (C-Chain), AVM (X-Chain), plus pluggable/`rpcchainvm` VMs for custom L1s.
- **Chain manager**: Boots P/C/X, creates new chains on request, routes consensus messages.
- **APIs**: HTTP/WS via `/ext/*`, with health/metrics, admin/info, and per-chain RPCs.
- **Storage**: LevelDB (default), PebbleDB, or [Firewood](/docs/nodes/architecture/execution/firewood) (experimental), shared atomic UTXO memory for cross-chain transfers.
- **Execution**: [Streaming Asynchronous Execution](/docs/nodes/architecture/execution/streaming-async-execution) (experimental) decouples consensus from execution for higher throughput.

## Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Network Layer** | P2P networking for peer discovery, message routing, and validator communication |
| **Chain Manager** | Orchestrates blockchain lifecycle, bootstrapping, and state synchronization |
| **Consensus Engines** | Snowman/Snowman++ for all Primary Network chains and most L1s |
| **Virtual Machines** | PlatformVM, Coreth, AVM, and custom VMs (native Go or `rpcchainvm`) |
| **API Server** | HTTP/HTTPS endpoints for interacting with the node |
| **Database** | Persistent storage using LevelDB (default) or PebbleDB; shared atomic memory |

## Primary Network Chains

AvalancheGo validates three chains on the Primary Network:

  <Card title="P-Chain (Platform)" href="/docs/primary-network">
    Manages validators, staking, subnets, and chain creation. Uses PlatformVM (Snowman++).
  </Card>
  <Card title="C-Chain (Contract)" href="/docs/primary-network">
    EVM-compatible chain for smart contracts. Uses Coreth (grafted go-ethereum) with Snowman++.
  </Card>
  <Card title="X-Chain (Exchange)" href="/docs/primary-network">
    High-throughput asset transfers using UTXO model. Uses AVM with Snowman (linearized in Cortina).
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Key Design Principles

### Modularity
AvalancheGo separates concerns into distinct layers:
- **Consensus** is decoupled from application logic
- **VMs** are pluggable and can be developed independently
- **Networking** is abstracted from chain-specific operations

### Extensibility
- Custom VMs can be loaded as plugins (native) or via `rpcchainvm` (any language)
- Avalanche L1s can run any VM that implements the required interface
- Chain configurations and upgrades can be customized per-network/chain

### Performance
- Sub-second finality through probabilistic consensus
- Parallel transaction processing across independent chains
- State sync and Snowman++ proposer windows to reduce contention and bootstrap faster
