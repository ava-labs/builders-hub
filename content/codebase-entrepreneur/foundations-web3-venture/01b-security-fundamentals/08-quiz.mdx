Great work finishing **[Module 1B](/academy/codebase-entrepreneur-foundations/01b-security-fundamentals/01-introduction)**! ðŸŽ‰ Completing a single module is a fantastic achievement on its own, but if you want to be certified, you'll need to complete [Module 1A](/academy/codebase-entrepreneur-foundations/01-legal-foundations/01-introduction), [Module 1B](/academy/codebase-entrepreneur-foundations/01b-security-fundamentals/01-introduction), [Module 2](/academy/codebase-entrepreneur-foundations/02-business-model-canvas/01-introduction), and [Module 3](/academy/codebase-entrepreneur-foundations/03-user-personas/01-introduction) to unlock the Foundations of a Web3 Venture certificate. Keep goingâ€”you're on your way! ðŸš€
