## Current Infrastructure State

By now, we have:
- **Created a Subnet-EVM L1** with its genesis file
- **Pre-deployed proxy infrastructure** at addresses `0xfacade...` (proxy) and `0xdad...` (admin)
- **Placeholder implementation** at `0x1212...` waiting to be upgraded

If we were to look at our L1, it would like something like this:

## Deployment Flow

The deployment process follows a specific sequence designed for safety and clarity:

1. **Deploy the Validator Manager implementation** - Create the actual contract with validation logic
2. **Upgrade the proxy** - Point `0xfacade...` to our new implementation via the admin at `0xdad...`
3. **Initialize the configuration** - Set up the initial validator set and permissions
4. **Activate validation** - Enable the contract to start managing validators on the P-Chain
