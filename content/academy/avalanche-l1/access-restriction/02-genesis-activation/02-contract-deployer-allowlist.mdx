## Overview

The **Contract Deployer AllowList** precompile controls **who can deploy smart contracts** on your Avalanche L1. If an address is not allowed, contract deployment transactions will revert.

This is commonly used to:

- Prevent malicious or unreviewed contract deployments
- Enforce “only approved deployers” policies (CI/CD wallets, audited teams)
- Run curated ecosystems with stronger guarantees

## Quick reference

From the docs:

- **Precompile address**: `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000`
- **Genesis config key**: `contractDeployerAllowListConfig`
- **Permission model**: uses the [AllowList interface](/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/allowlist-interface)

Docs: `/docs/avalanche-l1s/precompiles/deployer-allowlist`

## Genesis activation

To enable it from genesis, include a config block like:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "contractDeployerAllowListConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x...yourAdminAddress"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `adminAddresses` become **AllowList Admins** for this precompile.

## Summary

Key points:
- Contract Deployer AllowList gates *contract deployment* at the network level.
- It’s configured at genesis via `contractDeployerAllowListConfig`.
- It reuses the AllowList permission model (Admin/Manager/Enabled).
