### Client SDK

The main Avalanche client SDK for interacting with Avalanche nodes and building blockchain applications.

Features:

* Complete API coverage for P-Chain, X-Chain, and C-Chain.
* Full viem compatibility - anything you can do with viem works here.
* TypeScript-first design with full type safety.
* Abstractions over the JSON-RPC API to make your life easier.
* Wallet integration and transaction management.
* First-class APIs for interacting with Smart Contracts.
* Retrieve balances and UTXOs for addresses..
* Build, sign, and issue transactions to any chain.
* Perform cross-chain transfers between X, P and C chains.
* Add validators and delegators.
* Create subnets and blockchains, convert subnets to L1s.

The SDK is currently available in TypeScript, with more languages coming soon. If you are interested in a language that is not listed, please reach out to us in the [#dev-tools](https://discord.com/channels/578992315641626624/1280920394236297257) channel in the [Avalanche Discord](https://discord.gg/avax).
