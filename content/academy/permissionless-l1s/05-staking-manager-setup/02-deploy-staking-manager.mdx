import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/toolbox/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx"

This is the first step in setting up your Permissionless L1. You'll deploy the **NativeTokenStakingManager** implementation contract, which contains all the logic for managing validators and delegators with native token staking.

## What is NativeTokenStakingManager?

The `NativeTokenStakingManager` is a concrete implementation of `PoSValidatorManager` that:
- Allows permissionless addition and removal of validators who stake the L1's native token
- Manages delegators who can delegate their tokens to validators
- Distributes staking rewards through the Native Minter precompile
- Handles uptime-based reward calculations

## Deploy the Contract

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="l1">
    {/* Add deployment component here */}
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## Next Steps

After deploying the implementation contract, you'll need to deploy the Reward Calculator contract in the next step.
