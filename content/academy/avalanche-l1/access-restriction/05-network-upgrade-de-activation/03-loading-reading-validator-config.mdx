## Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

- Locate your chain’s config directory (the folder that contains `config.json`).
- Confirm where `upgrade.json` must be placed for your Blockchain ID.
- Access your Docker-hosted validator terminal to edit config files safely.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

- A running Docker-hosted AvalancheGo node for the L1 you created in:
  - `/academy/avalanche-l1/access-restriction/02-genesis-activation/03-console-creation-l1-with-self-hosted-node`
- Your **Blockchain ID** for that L1 (copied during chain creation).
- Access to the machine where the Docker container is running.

## Instructions

import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Step 1: Identify your Docker container

    In a terminal on the machine running Docker, list running containers and find the one running AvalancheGo:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 2: Open a shell inside the validator container

    Use `docker exec` to get a shell:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it <YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID> sh
    ```

    If `sh` isn’t available, try:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it <YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID> bash
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 3: Locate your chain config directory

    The upgrade guide expects `upgrade.json` to live next to `config.json` at:

    - `~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/<BLOCKCHAIN_ID>/`

    Inside the container, list the chain folders:

    ```bash
    ls ~/.avalanchego/configs/chains
    ```

    Then enter your chain’s folder (use your **Blockchain ID** from the earlier lesson):

    ```bash
    cd ~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/<YOUR_BLOCKCHAIN_ID>
    ls
    ```

    You should see a `config.json` file in this directory.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expected Output

You should have a terminal open inside the validator container and be able to `cd` into:

- `~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/<YOUR_BLOCKCHAIN_ID>/`

```
config.json
```

## Verification

To verify you've completed this exercise successfully:

1. You can list the chain folder and see `config.json`.
2. You know exactly where to create `upgrade.json` for the next step.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: I don’t see my Blockchain ID folder

**Problem**: `~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/` doesn’t contain your Blockchain ID.

**Solution**:
- Double-check you copied the **Blockchain ID** (not Subnet ID).
- Confirm you’re inside the correct container (the one actually running your L1).
- If your AvalancheGo container mounts config from the host, the chain configs may live on the host filesystem; in that case, edit the host-side mounted directory.

## Next Steps

Next, you’ll create `upgrade.json` entries that **disable** `txAllowListConfig` and `contractDeployerAllowListConfig`.
