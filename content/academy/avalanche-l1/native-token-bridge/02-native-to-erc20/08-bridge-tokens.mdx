# Bridge Your Native Token to C-Chain

With your bridge configured, you can now transfer your L1's native token to C-Chain, where it becomes an **ERC-20 token**.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect to Your L1

Switch your wallet to your **L1** (the source chain where your native token lives).

<Callout type="info">
You need native tokens (TEST) for the amount you want to bridge, **plus additional tokens** for gas.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Bridge using the Token Transfer tool

Use the tool below to initiate the cross-chain transfer:

1. Select your **NativeTokenHome** as the source bridge contract
2. Select your **ERC20TokenRemote** (on C-Chain) as the destination bridge contract
3. Enter the amount of native tokens to bridge

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Successfully registered the remote with the home
2. Native tokens in your wallet to bridge
3. Additional native tokens for gas fees
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
    <TestSend />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Switch to C-Chain and check your ERC-20 balance

Switch your wallet to **Fuji C-Chain** and check your ERC-20 balance.

You can add the ERC20TokenRemote contract address as a custom token in your wallet to see the balance.

</Step>
</Steps>

## What Happened

1. Your native tokens were **wrapped to WTEST** and locked in NativeTokenHome
2. An ICM message was sent to C-Chain via the relayer
3. ERC20TokenRemote **minted ERC-20 tokens** representing your native token
4. ERC-20 tokens were credited to your address on C-Chain

## Bridging Back

To bridge ERC-20 tokens back to your L1 as native tokens:

1. Switch to C-Chain
2. Use the Token Transfer tool with reversed source/destination
3. ERC-20 tokens will be burned and native tokens released on your L1

## Summary

You've successfully:

- Created an L1 with a custom native token
- Deployed a wrapped token (WTEST)
- Deployed NativeTokenHome on your L1
- Deployed ERC20TokenRemote on C-Chain
- Bridged native tokens → ERC-20

## What's Next?

In the next chapter, you'll learn how to use AVAX (C-Chain's native token) as the native gas token for your L1.
