In the previous section, we covered the main **token standards** used on Avalanche: ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155. Now, let’s explore **how these standards are applied today** in the Avalanche ecosystem across the C-Chain **Mainnet**, **Fuji (Testnet)**, and **custom L1s**.

## ERC-20: Fungible Token Use Cases

**On Avalanche C-Chain Mainnet**
- **Stablecoins**:  
  USDT: Widely used for DeFi protocols, payments, and trading pairs.  
  USDC: Popular for lending, liquidity provision, and cross-chain settlements.  
- **Native Avalanche Tokens**:  
  WAVAX: Wrapped AVAX used for liquidity pools, lending markets, and DEX operations.  
- **Governance Tokens**:  
  JOE: Token powering governance and incentives in Trader Joe.  
  QI: Governance token for Benqi lending and liquid staking platform.

**On L1 Deployments**
- **Custom Ecosystem Tokens**: L1 projects can issue ERC-20 tokens for payments, in-game economies, or DeFi services, with full control over tokenomics.

**On Avalanche C-Chain Fuji (Testnet)**
- Developers test token logic, minting, and burning before deploying to C-Chain or an L1, avoiding the cost of mainnet errors.

## ERC-721: Non-Fungible Token Use Cases

**On Avalanche C-Chain Mainnet**
- **NFT Marketplaces**:  
  Kalao: Marketplace for art, gaming, and utility NFTs.  
  NFTrade: Cross-chain NFT marketplace supporting Avalanche.  
- **In-Game Unique Assets**:  
  Gaming NFTs: Rare weapons, characters, and skins in Avalanche C-Chain-native games.

**On L1 Deployments**
- **Project-Specific Collections**: L1s can issue NFTs for branding, game achievements, or membership systems, keeping transactions isolated from C-Chain congestion.
- **Sports & Entertainment**: FIFA+ Collect: Official FIFA digital collectibles platform on L1 Avalanche, featuring historic moments, iconic goals, and tournament highlights.  

**On Avalanche C-Chain Fuji (Testnet)**
- Used to test metadata integration, marketplace listings, and batch minting.

## ERC-1155: Multi-Token Standard Use Cases

**On Avalanche C-Chain Mainnet**
- **Gaming Projects**:  
  Crabada: Combines fungible resources (minerals, tokens) with unique NFT characters in one contract.  
- **Collectible Platforms**:  
  Multi-series collections: Managed without deploying new contracts for each.

**On L1 Deployments**
- **Metaverse Economies**: L1s can host both in-game currencies and unique items in one ERC-1155 contract, benefiting from low latency and high scalability.

**On Avalanche C-Chain Fuji (Testnet)**
- Testing batch transfers, multi-asset minting, and marketplace integrations before L1 or C-Chain Mainnet launch.

## Observations from Avalanche’s Current Uses

- **Low Fees Enable Microtransactions**: The cost-efficiency of Avalanche makes even small-value ERC-20 and ERC-1155 transfers practical.  
- **L1s Enable Asset Isolation**: Projects with heavy transaction loads can launch their own L1 to keep asset operations unaffected by C-Chain activity.  
- **Fuji Testnet is a Critical Step**: Almost every major Avalanche project tests token standards on Fuji before going live.  
- **Bridging Expands Liquidity**: Avalanche supports assets from other EVM networks, extending utility and user reach.

In the **next section**, we will analyze **the limits companies face when using these standards**, focusing on challenges like **privacy, compliance, and scalability** and set the stage for introducing **privacy-focused solutions like eERC**.
