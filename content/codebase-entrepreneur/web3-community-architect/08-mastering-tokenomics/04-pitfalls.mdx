Common mistakes Web3 startups make include:

**Short-term focus**: Concentrating only on early growth and user acquisition without considering long-term sustainability. Gaming projects often use tokens for bootstrapping but ignore critical Web2 metrics like lifetime value, churn rate, and retention.

**Investor-centric design**: Thinking primarily about rewarding investors rather than building a balanced ecosystem that serves all economic agents: users, supporters, validators, customers, and liquidity providers.

**Supply-side obsession**: Controlling token distribution and vesting schedules while neglecting why people would use the tokens. Successful tokenomics requires utility and incentives to hold/use tokens (such as discounts for paying in tokens vs. fiat).

Real-world examples illustrate these principles:

**Success stories:**

- Bittensor pivoted its economic model from validator rewards to allowing AI projects to issue backed tokens
- Hyperliquid prioritized product quality first, then used tokens to enhance user acquisition and retention

**Cautionary tales:**
- Eigen Layer developed a strong product with significant TVL, but unfair token distribution and poor market timing led to price collapse
- Axie Infinity initially thrived when it combined a fun game with earning mechanisms, but collapsed when people played solely for money extraction
