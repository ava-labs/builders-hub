## Overview

NodeCloud is a multichain RPC infrastructure suite that gives developers fast, reliable access to blockchain endpoints across more than 180 networks. Powered by a distributed pool of over 40 global providers across 9 geoclusters, NodeCloud combines smart routing, advanced key controls, analytics, and front-end protection in a single platform. It is designed for teams that want high performance without operating their own infrastructure.

## Features

- **Smart Routing**: NodeCloud uses intelligent routing across 40-plus providers to deliver stable, low-latency RPC requests globally.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Monitor performance, request patterns, errors, and usage trends with real-time analytics built directly into the platform.
- **Advanced key control**: Manage API keys with granular permissions, rate control, rotation, and team-level access policies.
- **Front-end Protection**: Block abusive traffic, prevent key leakage, and protect public applications with built in safeguards.
- **Flat pricing**: Free tier available with rate limits, and paid plans starting from 10 dollars offer no request or rate limits.

## Getting Started

To start using NodeCloud, follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account on [dRPC](https://drpc.org/nodecloud-multichain-rpc-management).
2. **Generate a key**: Choose the blockchain network you want to connect to and create your API key in the NodeCloud dashboard.
3. **Select a network**: NodeCloud supports 180 plus networks including Avalanche, Ethereum, Polygon, Base, Solana, Arbitrum, Optimism, and more.
4. **Integrate with Your Project**: Use your API key in any RPC compatible library, SDK, or direct JSON RPC request. NodeCloud works with all standard EVM, Solana, and Cosmos tooling.
