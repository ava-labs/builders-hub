To implement effective tokenomics in your startup:

1. **Start with your product**: Ensure you have a valuable product or service before designing token mechanisms. Tokens support good products but can't save bad ones.

2. **Identify all economic agents**: Map out every type of participant in your ecosystem (users, developers, validators, investors) and design incentives for each.

3. **Balance supply and demand**: Consider both token distribution (supply) and utility (demand) in your design.

4. **Implement fair distribution**: Ensure tokens are allocated fairly across all stakeholders, not just investors.

5. **Measure success holistically**: Track both Web3 metrics (TVL, token price) and traditional Web2 metrics (user retention, lifetime value).

6. **Plan for evolution**: Design update mechanisms that allow your tokenomics to adapt as your ecosystem grows and market conditions change.

7. **Create genuine utility**: Give users concrete reasons to hold and use your token beyond speculation (discounts, access rights, governance).
