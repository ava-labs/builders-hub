## Introduction to Legal Structures for Web3

### The Foundation of Web3 Legal Compliance
Before launching any Web3 startup or token project, entrepreneurs must establish proper legal structures to protect themselves and ensure regulatory compliance. Unlike traditional startups, Web3 companies face unique challenges related to token classification, cross-border regulations, and evolving legal frameworks.

### Choosing Your Legal Jurisdiction

  <p>"The first step any Web3 organization needs to take is to choose the right legal jurisdiction -  or in other words - the place where you're going to register your legal entity. You don't need to live there. You don't need to work there, but this is the place where your business will be created."</p>

The first step for any Web3 organization is selecting the right legal jurisdiction. This decision impacts taxation, privacy, regulatory oversight, and access to funding.

The optimal jurisdiction depends on your project's goals, structure, and target markets—and should be chosen with both current requirements and long-term adaptability in mind. Startups should look for:

- Competitive tax frameworks
- Strong privacy protections
- Clear digital asset regulations
- Legislative support for DAOs and decentralized structures
- Efficient corporate registration and governance processes

### Forming Your Legal Entity
After selecting a jurisdiction, you'll need to form a legal entity. In the United States, most startups opt for a C Corporation structure, particularly if they plan to raise venture capital.

For Delaware incorporation, basic requirements include:
- Costs ranging from $50-500 depending on setup details
- Filing a certificate of formation
- Designating a registered agent
- Submitting annual reports and tax filings

While Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) or partnerships might be suitable for some early-stage companies, the C Corp structure typically provides the most flexibility for fundraising and growth.
