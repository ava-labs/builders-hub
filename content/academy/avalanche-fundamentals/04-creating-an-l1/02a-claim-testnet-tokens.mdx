Connect your Core wallet below and claim some testnet AVAX on the C-Chain and P-Chain. You need a
Builder Hub Account to do so. If you're experiencing issues or do not want to create a Builder Hub
Account, you can use the alternative faucet below.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
    <Faucet />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## Alternative faucet

If you're experiencing issues or do not want to create a Builder Hub Account, you can also use the
[Avalanche Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) to claim some AVAX on
the C-Chain.

Use the code `avalanche-academy` or `avalanche-academy25` to get 2 AVAX on the C-Chain.

After you have claimed some AVAX on the C-Chain, you can bridge it to the P-Chain using this tool:

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
    <CrossChainTransfer />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>
