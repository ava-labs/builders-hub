## Permissioned L1s 

Welcome to the **Permissioned L1s** course! This course is designed to give you a deep
understanding of configuring, launching and maintaining permissioned L1s on Avalanche. By the end of this course, you will have
practical skills in deploying an L1 and managing the validator set in a Proof of Authority (PoA)
network.
