To ensure the wrapped token is bridged into the destination chain (in this case, C-Chain) you'll need to deploy a _remote_ contract that implements the `IERC20Bridge` interface, as well as inheriting the properties of `TeleporterTokenRemote`. In order for the bridged tokens to have all the normal functionality of a locally deployed ERC20 token, this remote contract must also inherit the properties of a standard `ERC20` contract.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Test DIS

Before deploying the remote contract, ensure you have some test DIS, head to the [Avalanche Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=dispatch&token=dispatch) and claim some DIS tokens on the Dispatch of the Fuji testnet.

<Step>
### Deploy the Remote Contract

Now we'll deploy the ERC20TokenRemote contract to the Echo chain. Use our toolbox:

<Callout>
Make sure you have:
1. Deployed your ERC-20 token (from [Deploy ERC-20 Token](/academy/interchain-token-transfer/06-erc-20-to-erc-20-bridge/02-deploy-erc-20-token))
2. Deployed your ERC20Home contract (from [Deploy Home](/academy/interchain-token-transfer/06-erc-20-to-erc-20-bridge/03-deploy-home))
3. Have enough test ECH for gas fees
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={779672}>
    <DeployERC20TokenRemote />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Save the Remote Contract Address

After deployment, you'll need to save the contract address for future steps. You can find it in the deployment confirmation in the toolbox.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
Keep this address handy as you'll need it for the next steps in the bridging process.
</Callout>
