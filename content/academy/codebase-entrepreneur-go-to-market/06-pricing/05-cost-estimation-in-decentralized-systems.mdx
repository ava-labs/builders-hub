Accurately tracking costs requires robust monitoring tools:

- Datadog, Grafana, and Prometheus provide granular usage details
- AWS/GCP dashboards help track cloud provider expenses
- Custom dashboards may be needed for blockchain-specific metrics

Beyond basic COGS, successful Web3 projects track key SaaS metrics including:
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Usage volume and adoption rates
- Churn rate and net revenue retention
- Customer acquisition costs
