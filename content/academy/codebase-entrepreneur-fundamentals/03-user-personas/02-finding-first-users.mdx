The first step in building successful Web3 products is identifying communities that actually need blockchain technology—not where it's merely trendy, but where people lack visibility, access, or ownership.

</div> 

These communities often form in places like Discord, Telegram, and Twitter/X, where incentivized early adopters gather to discuss new solutions to their problems. A strategic approach is to start with geographic targeting, then narrow down to specific industries or sectors within that area.

  <p>"We live in a very noisy and loud space, where the community of our users typically has some sort of direct access to the founders and developers of products, whether that's a Discord, whether a Telegram channel, whether that's on Twitter as the public forum."</p>

When searching for your first users, look for places where traditional systems aren't serving people well—these are the communities most receptive to blockchain-based alternatives.
