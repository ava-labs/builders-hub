1. **Be bold but realistic**: Avalanche wants to hear moonshot pitches, but they need to be grounded in reality with clear execution plans.

2. **Build before you apply**: Don't wait for a grant to start building. Having a prototype or proof of concept significantly strengthens your application.

3. **Connect with the community**: Engage with the Avalanche ecosystem before, during, and after your application process.

4. **Focus on ecosystem impact**: Clearly articulate how your project contributes to Avalanche's growth and addresses specific ecosystem needs.

5. **Prepare for partnerships**: The foundation can connect you with other projects, validators, and institutional partners - be ready to collaborate.
