## Where can the Validator Manager contract be deployed?

Avalanche’s **Validator Manager Contract (VMC)** can be deployed in two places:

- **On your L1**
- **On the Avalanche C-Chain**

This choice affects how resilient your validator operations are and how easy it will be to transition from **permissioned (PoA)** to **permissionless (PoS)**.

## Quick decision rule

- **Deploy on your L1** if you expect to remain **PoA / permissioned** long-term and want a self-contained setup.
- **Deploy on C-Chain** if you plan to become **PoS / permissionless**, or want the option to upgrade to PoS later.

<Callout type="warning">
You can upgrade contract logic, but you **cannot move** the VMC location after deployment without redeploying.
</Callout>

## Why PoS makes this more important

In PoS, you typically care more about:

- **Operational robustness** (validator management even if your L1 is degraded)
- **Permissionless onboarding** (external validators joining over time)
- **Long-term flexibility** as economics and validator sets evolve

That’s why “deploy on C‑Chain” is often a better default if you expect a PoS transition.

## For the permissionless L1 track demo

In the earlier permissioned L1 walkthroughs, the **demo deploys the VMC on the L1** (PoA context) to keep the end-to-end flow fully contained within the L1 you’re building and operating.
