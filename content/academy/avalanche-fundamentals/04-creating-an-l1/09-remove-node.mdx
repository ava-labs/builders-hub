Now that you have tested your L1, you can stop and remove the node. This is useful if you want to free up resources or if you want to start a new node with different parameters.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Stop Node

To stop the node, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker stop avago
```

The node credentials and the blockchain state is persisted in the `~/.avalanchego` directory. When
you restart the node with `docker start avago` it will pick up where it left off.

</Step>
<Step>

### Remove Node

```bash
docker rm avago
```

This will not remove the state and credentials of the node. To remove these you need to delete the `~/.avalanchego` directory.
