# Set Up the Relayer

Token bridging uses Interchain Messaging (ICM) under the hood, so you must run a relayer between your **L1** and **Fuji C-Chain**.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="l1">
  <ICMRelayer />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## Instructions

In the tool above:
1. Select your **L1** and **Fuji C-Chain** as the networks to relay between
2. Fund the generated relayer address with enough gas on **both** chains
3. Run the provided Docker command to start the relayer

<Callout type="info">
If you don't have the relayer running, cross-chain messages will be created but **never delivered**, and your bridge transfers will appear "stuck".
</Callout>

## Next Steps

With the relayer running, you're ready to deploy `NativeTokenHome` on your L1.
