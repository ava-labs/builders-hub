It's important to understand that your **native token and staking token don't necessarily have to be the same**:

- **Native Token**: Used for paying transaction fees (gas)
- **Staking Token**: Used for validator rewards and network security

This separation allows for more flexible tokenomics design and can optimize different aspects of your blockchain's economy.

**Validator management and staking tokenomics** will be covered in:
- [Permissioned L1s](/academy/permissioned-l1s) course: Learn about validator manager deployment options
- [Permissionless L1s](/academy/permissionless-l1s) course: Learn about staking tokenomics and validator economics
