### Deploy ERC-20

Let's deploy a basic demo ERC20 token on the Fuji testnet using our toolbox.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
    <DeployExampleERC20 />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>
<Step>

### Add Token to Core Wallet

After deploying your ERC-20 token:

1. Open Core Wallet
2. Go to the Tokens tab
3. Click "Manage"
4. Click "+ Add Custom Token"
5. Enter the token contract address from the deployment
6. The token symbol and decimals should be automatically detected
7. Click "Add Token"

<Callout>
Make sure you're connected to the Fuji testnet when adding the token. The token will only be visible on the network where it was deployed.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

### Transfer ERC-20 Token

To transfer your ERC-20 token:

1. In Core Wallet, select your token from the token list
2. Click "Send"
3. Enter the recipient's address
4. Enter the amount to transfer
5. Review the transaction details
6. Click "Send" to confirm

<Callout>
Always double-check the recipient address before sending. ERC-20 transfers cannot be reversed once confirmed.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify Transfer

To verify the transfer was successful:

1. Check the transaction status in Core Wallet
2. View the transaction details on the [Fuji Explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io)
3. The recipient can add the token to their Core Wallet to see their balance

<Callout>
If the recipient doesn't see the token in their wallet, they'll need to add it using the token contract address, just like you did in step 2.
</Callout>

</Step>
