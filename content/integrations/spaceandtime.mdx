## Overview
Space and Time is a decentralized data warehouse that provides a blockchain indexing services for major blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche etc., for developers to access real-time data and build data-driven apps.

## Key Features.

- **Integration with Major Chains**: Space and Time integrates with major blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche, enabling developers to easily connect data to smart contracts.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Space and Time leverages zero-knowledge proofs to enhance data privacy and integrity, allowing for secure and verifiable computations.
- **Proof of SQL**: This protocol ensures that off-chain compute results are cryptographically verifiable, enhancing data integrity and trust.
- **Smart Contract Indexing**: Allows developers to generate custom tables in Space and Time from their own smart contract events.

## Getting Started

To begin exploring Avalanche data from Space and Time;

1. **Create UserID**: Create a new user with a username and password by registering via [Dreamspace](https://app.spaceandtime.ai).
2. **Create API key**: To authenticate your app queries, create an API key. 
- Go to "My Account" then click on "Account settings" 
- Add a label (e.g., "AvalancheApp") and click add.
- Copy the API key shown; it will not be displayed again.
3. **Explore Indexed Avalanche Data Sets**: Go to the "Datasets" tab where you'll see all tables.
4. **Run your first avalanche Query**: Use the Query Editor to run queries directly on Avalanche chain data.
5. **Use Avalanche Data in your App**: Once your query works, you can fetch the results from your app via Space and Time's REST API.

## Use-Cases

1. **Sub-second ZK Coprocessor**: Space and Time pioneered the first sub-second ZK coprocessor so that your smart contract can ask data-driven questions about indexed data from every major chain and offchain data from any source in a realtime, ZK-proven way.
2. **Onchain app development**: Build data-driven apps with pre-built APIs for SQL operations. Run SQL against your own offchain data tables and tables with realtime blockchain data that we've indexed from major chains.
3. **DeFi/lending**: With Space and Time, you can combine real-world credit scores with onchain transactions to create new Web3 credit scores for decentralized lending platforms.
4. **Gaming/NFTs**: Power your game with extremely low-latency transactions and run scale-out analytics against terabytes of data. 
5. **Tamperproof SQL ledger**: Space and Time lets you prove compliance, track supply chain history, maintain an auditable record of financial transactions, and more by ensuring that your data is accurate, verifiable, and traceable at all times.
6. **Verifiable LLMs**: Build transparent, tamperproof, and provably neutral LLMs. 

## Conclusion
Space and Time (SXT Chain) is the first trustless database for the EVM, enabling smart contracts to interact with historical, cross-chain, or offchain data as if it were natively accessible onchain.
