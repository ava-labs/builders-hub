import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';
import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/toolbox/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx";
import { TransferOwnership } from "@/components/toolbox/console/permissioned-l1s/multisig-setup/TransferOwnership.tsx";

Now that the PoA Manager is deployed and owned by your Safe wallet, we need to transfer ownership of the Validator Manager Contract to the PoA Manager.

## Why This Transfer?

Currently, your EOA (externally owned account) directly owns the Validator Manager. This means you alone can:
- Add validators
- Remove validators
- Change validator weights

By transferring ownership to the PoA Manager, you're inserting it as an intermediary that your multi-sig controls.

## Important Considerations

<Callout type="warning">
**This action is significant!** After transferring ownership, you will no longer be able to directly manage validators. All operations will need to go through the PoA Manager, which is controlled by your multi-sig.

Make sure you have access to the required number of signers before proceeding.
</Callout>

### Pre-Transfer Checklist

Before transferring ownership, verify:

- ✅ **PoA Manager Deployed**: You have a valid PoA Manager address
- ✅ **Safe Ownership**: Your Safe wallet owns the PoA Manager
- ✅ **Signer Access**: You have access to the required number of signers
- ✅ **Test Transaction**: Consider testing a simple Safe transaction first

## Transfer Ownership

Use the tool below to transfer Validator Manager ownership to your PoA Manager:

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
    <TransferOwnership />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## What Happens During Transfer

When you call `transferOwnership()`:

1. **Verification**: The Validator Manager verifies you're the current owner
2. **State Update**: The `_owner` state variable is updated to the PoA Manager address
3. **Event Emission**: An `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted
4. **Immediate Effect**: From this moment, only the PoA Manager can call owner-restricted functions

```solidity
// Simplified transfer logic
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
    require(newOwner != address(0), "New owner is zero address");
    _transferOwnership(newOwner);
}

function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal {
    address oldOwner = _owner;
    _owner = newOwner;
    emit OwnershipTransferred(oldOwner, newOwner);
}
```

## Verification

After the transfer completes:

1. **Check VMC Owner**: The Validator Manager's `owner()` should return the PoA Manager address
2. **Test Access**: Your EOA should no longer be able to call owner-restricted functions

## Complete Ownership Chain

With this transfer complete, you now have the full multi-sig governance chain:

```
Safe/Ash Wallet
    ↓ owns
PoA Manager
    ↓ owns
Validator Manager
    ↓ manages
P-Chain Validators
```

## Next Steps

Your multi-sig setup is now complete! In the next chapter, you'll learn how to perform validator operations through this new governance structure.

**Key differences in the new flow:**
- Operations are proposed in the Safe wallet
- Multiple signers must approve
- Approved transactions are executed through the PoA Manager
- The PoA Manager calls the Validator Manager
