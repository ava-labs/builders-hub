## Access Restriction

Access restriction is a core requirement for many real-world networks: you may need to control **who can submit transactions** and **who can deploy contracts** to meet operational, institutional, and compliance needs.

In Avalanche L1s, these controls are implemented as **precompiles** (native EVM features) that follow a shared, audited permission model: the **AllowList interface**.

## Course Content

    ### Introduction
    Precompiles refresher, the AllowList permission model (Admin/Manager/Enabled), and why this pattern is reused across multiple L1 precompiles.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Genesis Activation
    Configure and launch an L1 with **Transaction AllowList** and **Contract Deployer AllowList** enabled from genesis (self-hosted node via Docker).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Everyone Makes Mistakes
    Intentionally lock yourself out, observe failures, and learn the recovery path (network upgrade sections come next).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, we recommend completing:

- [Customizing the EVM](/academy/avalanche-l1/customizing-evm) — especially the **Precompiles** section
- Comfort using **Core Wallet**, **Docker**, and reading a **genesis JSON**

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Explain what precompiles are and why they’re used for privileged network features
- Describe the AllowList interface roles (**Admin**, **Manager**, **Enabled**) and how they apply across multiple precompiles
- Enable **Transaction AllowList** and **Contract Deployer AllowList** in genesis
- Validate access restrictions by testing transaction sending and contract deployment
