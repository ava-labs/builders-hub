The contracts in the [`validator-manager`](https://github.com/ava-labs/icm-contracts/tree/main/contracts/validator-manager) branch define the Validator Manager used to manage Subnet-only Validators. 

For this section we have blurred out some of the contracts, as these are not relevant to the Proof of Authority hierarchy used to create a **permissioned L1**:

    -_initiateValidatorRemoval()
    -_initiateValidatorWeightUpdate()
}
<<Abstract>> ACP99Manager

## Understanding Contract Hierarchy

The validator management system follows a layered architecture, with each level adding specific functionality:

### ACP99Manager (Abstract Foundation)

The `ACP99Manager` is the foundational abstract contract that standardizes validator management for EVM-based L1s, as defined in ACP-99. This standard emerged after ACP-77 introduced the protocol-level capability for L1s to manage their own validators. ACP99Manager provides four essential functions that all validator managers must implement:

- **`initializeValidatorSet()`**: Establishes the initial validator set when converting an existing Subnet to an L1
- **`completeValidatorRegistration()`**: Finalizes validator addition after P-Chain confirmation
- **`completeValidatorRemoval()`**: Finalizes validator removal after P-Chain confirmation
- **`completeValidatorWeightUpdate()`**: Finalizes weight changes after P-Chain confirmation

These functions handle the critical interactions with the P-Chain through Warp messages, forming the backbone of cross-chain validator management.

### ValidatorManager (Concrete Implementation)

The `ValidatorManager` extends `ACP99Manager` and adds the complete validator lifecycle management:

**Core Additions:**
- **`initiateValidatorRegistration()`** (onlyOwner): Starts the process of adding a new validator
- **`initiateValidatorRemoval()`** (onlyOwner): Begins removing a validator from the active set
- **`initiateValidatorWeightUpdate()`** (onlyOwner): Initiates changes to a validator's voting weight

**Key Features:**
- All state-changing functions are protected with `onlyOwner` modifier
- Implements the two-phase commit pattern: initiate â†’ complete
- Manages churn rate limiting to prevent rapid validator set changes
- Tracks validator states throughout their lifecycle
- Handles Warp message construction and verification
