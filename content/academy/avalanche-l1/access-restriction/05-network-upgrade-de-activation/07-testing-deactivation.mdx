## Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

- Connect Core Wallet to your custom L1 and open the allowlist Console tools.
- Confirm the console detects that the precompiles are **not active**.
- Distinguish “precompile not active” from “I’m not authorized”.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

- Restarted your Docker validator after adding `upgrade.json` disable entries (previous lesson).
- Core Wallet connected to the **same custom L1** you created earlier.

## Instructions

import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';
import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/toolbox/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx";
import DeployerAllowlist from "@/components/toolbox/console/l1-access-restrictions/DeployerAllowlist";
import TransactionAllowlist from "@/components/toolbox/console/l1-access-restrictions/TransactionAllowlist";

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Step 1: Verify Transaction Allowlist is not available

    Open the Transaction Allowlist tool below while your wallet is connected to your custom L1:

    <ToolboxMdxWrapper>
      <TransactionAllowlist />
    </ToolboxMdxWrapper>

    **Expected Result**: the component should render a “not available” / “precompile not activated” state (an image + message), because `txAllowListConfig` is now disabled via network upgrade.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 2: Verify Deployer Allowlist is not available

    Repeat for the Deployer Allowlist tool:

    <ToolboxMdxWrapper>
      <DeployerAllowlist />
    </ToolboxMdxWrapper>

    **Expected Result**: the component should render a “not available” / “precompile not activated” state, because `contractDeployerAllowListConfig` is now disabled.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 3: Confirm you’re on the right network

    If you don’t see the “not available” state, confirm:

    - Your Core Wallet is connected to your **custom L1** (not C-Chain / Fuji / another network).
    - Your Docker validator is running the chain created in:
      - `/academy/avalanche-l1/access-restriction/02-genesis-activation/03-console-creation-l1-with-self-hosted-node`

    <Callout type="info">
    This check verifies “the precompile is inactive”, which is different from “the precompile is active but my address is not authorized”.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expected Output

Both embedded console components show a “not available / not activated” state when connected to your custom L1.

```
Precompile not activated / Not available on this network
```

## Verification

To verify you've completed this exercise successfully:

1. `TransactionAllowlist` displays the “not available” state.
2. `DeployerAllowlist` displays the “not available” state.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: The tools still show the full allowlist UI

**Problem**: The precompiles may still be active, or you’re connected to a different network.

**Solution**:
- Re-check the Docker node logs to confirm the `upgrade.json` was loaded.
- Confirm your `upgrade.json` timestamps have passed (a block after the timestamp must be accepted).
- Confirm your wallet is connected to the correct L1.

## Next Steps

Next, you’ll perform the opposite operation: re-enable these precompiles via another network upgrade and set your wallet as the admin for both.
