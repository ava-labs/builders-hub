## Key Take-Aways

- **Treat fundraising as a sales funnel** with distinct stages requiring different approaches
- **Start relationship-building with investors** months before you need capital
- **Prepare different versions of your pitch materials** for different fundraising contexts
- **Send regular investor updates** that show growth and include specific asks
- **Cold outreach works** when personalized, targeted, and occasionally unconventional
- **Don't over-optimize for valuation** at the expense of securing good partners
- **Focus on the metrics** that truly demonstrate your product's market fit and growth potential
- **Be transparent about challenges**â€”honesty builds trust with investors

Remember: fundraising is not just about securing capital; it's about finding partners who will help you build a successful company. The relationships you build during this process often matter more than the terms on the term sheet.
