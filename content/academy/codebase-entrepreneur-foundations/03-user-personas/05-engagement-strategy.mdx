### Direct Communication Approach

While scalability is a core blockchain value, successful founders often take an "unscalable" approach to early user relationships. This means:

- Personally engaging with users daily 
- Conducting regular check-in calls 
- Making users feel like team members rather than just customers

This high-touch approach builds strong retention because users feel personally invested in the project's success. When users know the founders and understand the company's ethos, they're less likely to abandon the product during inevitable challenges.

### Systematic Feedback Processing

To make user feedback actionable:

1. Document all inputs and organize them systematically
2. Track how many users mention the same issues
3. Cross-reference with product data to confirm patterns
4. Analyze the time investment vs. potential impact of changes
5. Prioritize high-impact changes that require minimal time

This systematic approach not only improves your product but also encourages continued feedback when users see their suggestions implemented.

### Customer Interview Best Practices

When conducting interviews:
- Focus on "cold" users rather than friends who might sugarcoat feedback
- Contact new users within 2-3 minutes of sign-up for highest engagement
- Use silence strategically to make interviewees comfortable and honest
- Follow up with a sequence: Call → Voicemail → Text if needed
- Always ask: "Is there anything I didn't ask that I should have?"

The goal is to listen, allowing users to express their true needs rather than confirming your assumptions.
