The `ERC20TokenHome` contract is deployed on Fuji C-Chain. It locks USDC when users bridge to your L1 and releases USDC when they bridge back.

## USDC on Fuji

We're using the official Circle USDC on Fuji testnet:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Contract Address** | `0x5425890298aed601595a70AB815c96711a31Bc65` |
| **Symbol** | USDC |
| **Decimals** | 6 |
| **Faucet** | [Circle Faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/) |

<Callout type="info">
Make sure you already have **1 USDC** in your wallet from the Circle faucet (Step 1 of this chapter).
</Callout>

## Understanding ERC20TokenHome

The ERC20TokenHome contract:

- **Locks USDC** when users bridge to your L1
- **Releases USDC** when users bridge back from your L1
- **Manages remote contract registrations** for security
- **Communicates via ICM** (Interchain Messaging)

<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect to Fuji C-Chain

Ensure your wallet is connected to **Fuji C-Chain** (Chain ID: 43113).

</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy ERC20TokenHome

Use the Deploy Token Home tool below:

1. Select **"ERC-20 Token"** as the Transferrer Type
2. Enter the USDC token address: `0x5425890298aed601595a70AB815c96711a31Bc65`
3. Confirm the **Teleporter Registry** address is set

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have:
1. Connected your Core Wallet to Fuji testnet
2. Sufficient test AVAX for gas fees
3. Selected "ERC-20 Token" as the transferrer type
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>
    <DeployTokenHome />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

<Step>
### Save the Contract Address

After deployment, save the **Token Home Address**. You'll need it when deploying the NativeTokenRemote contract on your L1.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Contract State After Deployment

After deployment, your ERC20TokenHome:

- Is linked to USDC (`0x5425890298aed601595a70AB815c96711a31Bc65`)
- Is connected to the Teleporter Registry for ICM
- Is ready to accept remote contract registrations
- Has no remote contracts registered yet

## Next Steps

Now deploy `NativeTokenRemote` on your L1 to complete the bridge setup.
