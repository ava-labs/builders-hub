In this section you will learn how to create an L1 in the Avalanche network. The following steps will be covered:

1. Installing and connecting Core Wallet
2. Claim AVAX on the C-Chain of the Fuji testnet from the Faucet
3. Transfer the AVAX from the C-Chain to P-Chain of the Fuji testnet
4. Create a Subnet by issuing a `CreateSubnetTx` on the P-Chain
5. Create the genesis file for an EVM chain and add it to your Subnet by issuing a `CreateChainTx`
   on the P-Chain
6. Start a node tracking this Subnet with Docker
7. Convert the Subnet to an L1 and add your node as a validator by issuing a `ConvertSubnetToL1Tx`
   on the P-Chain
8. Query the P-Chain state and inspect your l1
