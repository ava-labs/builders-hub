Lets start by deploying our sender contract on C-Chain. It will be responsible for calling the the TeleporterMessenger contract, encoding our message and sending it to the destination chain. 

<Steps>
<Step>
### Read the Sender Contract

The following contract is located inside `contracts/interchain-messaging/send-receive` directory. Read through the contract below and and understand what is happening:

```solidity title="contracts/interchain-messaging/send-receive/senderOnCChain.sol"
// (c) 2023, Ava Labs, Inc. All rights reserved.
// See the file LICENSE for licensing terms.

// SPDX-License-Identifier: Ecosystem

pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

import "@teleporter/ITeleporterMessenger.sol"; // [!code highlight]

contract SenderOnCChain {
    ITeleporterMessenger public immutable messenger = ITeleporterMessenger(0x253b2784c75e510dD0fF1da844684a1aC0aa5fcf); // [!code highlight]

    /**
     * @dev Sends a message to another chain.
     */
    function sendMessage(address destinationAddress, string calldata message) external {
        messenger.sendCrossChainMessage( // [!code highlight]
            TeleporterMessageInput({
                // BlockchainID of Dispatch L1
                destinationBlockchainID: 0x9f3be606497285d0ffbb5ac9ba24aa60346a9b1812479ed66cb329f394a4b1c7, // [!code highlight]
                destinationAddress: destinationAddress, 
                feeInfo: TeleporterFeeInfo({feeTokenAddress: address(0), amount: 0}),
                requiredGasLimit: 100000,
                allowedRelayerAddresses: new address[](0),
                message: abi.encode(message)
            })
        );
    }
}
```

The key things to understand:

- **Importing ITeleporterMessenger (Line 8):** We are importing the `ITeleporterMessenger` Interface we looked at in the previous activity.
- **Defining teleporterMessenger contract (Line 12):** We are defining a `teleporterMessenger` contract using the imported interface. It is important to note, that our cross-chain dApp is not implementing the interface itself, but initializes a contract using that interface.
- **Sending the message (Line 21):** We are sending the message by calling the function of our `teleporterMessenger`. As an input we are defining a `TeleporterMessageInput`. The `destinationChainId` should be set to the Dispatch test L1's blockchain ID. We will need to provide the address of the receiving contract on the Dispatch test L1 as a parameter to the function, since we have not deployed it yet and don't know the address at this time.   
- **No fees (Line 25):** In this exercise we are not providing any fees to the relayer for relaying the message. This is only possible since the relayer we are running here is configured to pick up any message even if it does not provide any rewards.
- **Encoding the Message (Line 31):** The `TeleporterMessageInput` defines a message as an array of bytes. For now we will just simply encode the string with `abi.encode()`. In the future activities, you will see how we can encode multiple values of any type in that message.
- **Hardcoded destinationBlockchainId:** For this course, we are using Dispatch, but normally you will have to replace the `destinationBlockchainID` with whatever chain you want to send a message to.

### Deploy Sender Contract

To deploy a contract using Foundry use the following command:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url fuji-c --private-key $PK contracts/interchain-messaging/send-receive/senderOnCChain.sol:SenderOnCChain --broadcast
```
```

### Save Sender Address

Then save the sender contract address in an environment variable:

```bash
export SENDER_ADDRESS={your-sender-address}
```
