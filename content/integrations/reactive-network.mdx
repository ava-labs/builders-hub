## Overview

Reactive Network is a fully on-chain, EVM-compatible, events-driven if-this-then-that network for decentralized automation of on-chain workflows through enabling reactivity between contracts deployed either on the same or different chains. Core purpose of Reactive is to enable more autonomous, self-sufficient and user friendly dApps.

## Features

- **Decentralized automation**: Web3’s first IFTTT infrastructure. Automate multi-chain workflows with event-driven logic – execute actions without compromising decentralization.
- **Cost-efficient Execution**: Offload heavy computations to Reactive’s parallelized EVM. Complex logic at minimal cost.
- **Inversion of Control**: RSCs invert the traditional execution model by allowing the contract itself to decide when to execute based on predefined events, eliminating the need for external triggers like bots or users.
- **DeFAI-Ready Infrastructure**: Create autonomous DeFi agents with on-chain data triggers and off-chain AI intelligence that trade, optimize, and adapt.

## Getting Started

To start using Reactive Network:

1. **Review Documentation**: Study the [Reactive Network Documentation](https://dev.reactive.network).
2. **Check out Reactive's [origins and destinations](https://dev.reactive.network/origins-and-destinations)**, along with their Callback Proxy addresses. 
3. **Connect to [Reactive Mainnet or Kopli Testnet](https://dev.reactive.network/reactive-mainnet)**.
4. **Explore what can be built**:
    - Hands-on [demonstrations](https://dev.reactive.network/demos) for the Reactive Network.
    - Clone the [GitHub](https://github.com/Reactive-Network/reactive-smart-contract-demos) project and start building.
5. **Learn more** about Reactive Smart Contracts in our [educational course](https://dev.reactive.network/education/introduction).

## Use Cases

Reactive Network supports a wide range of cross-chain automations:

- **Decentralized Trading Automation**: Automate gasless cross-chain swaps, enabling a frictionless P2P crypto trading experience.
- **Dynamic NFT Royalty System**: Enable real-time royalty adjustments, automate cross-chain transactions, and ensure transparent, fair revenue distribution for creators, buyers, and marketplaces.
- **Flash Profit Extractor**: Automate token swaps, dynamic pricing, and real-time price tracking, making DeFi arbitrage accessible and efficient.
- **Cross-Chain Lending**: Borrow assets across multiple blockchains.

## Conclusion

Reactive Network is an EVM-compatible execution layer that allows developers to create dApps using reactive contracts. These contracts differ from traditional smart contracts by using inversion-of-control for the transaction lifecycle, driven by data flows across blockchains rather than user input. Put simply - fully onchain, events driven if-this-then-that network for decentralized automation or simplification of workflows. Whether you're a seasoned or new blockchain developer, all you need is knowledge of Solidity. Reactive is not just a toolkit — it’s a new execution paradigm for Avalanche and beyond.
