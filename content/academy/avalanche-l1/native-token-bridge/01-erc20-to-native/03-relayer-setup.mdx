# Set Up the Relayer

Token bridging uses Interchain Messaging (ICM) under the hood, so you need a relayer between **Fuji C-Chain** and your **new L1** to deliver cross-chain messages.

We'll use a **hosted relayer** (no Docker required) that's perfect for testing. The relayer will automatically shut down after 3 days.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="testnet-mainnet">
  <CreateManagedTestnetRelayer />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## Instructions

In the tool above:
1. Select **Fuji C-Chain** and your **new L1** as the networks to relay between
2. Create the hosted relayer (it will automatically start running)
3. Fund the relayer address with enough gas on **both** chains if needed

<Callout type="info">
**Note**: Hosted relayers are free and perfect for testing. They automatically shut down after 3 days. For production or extended testing, use a self-hosted relayer.

If you don't have the relayer running, cross-chain messages will be created but **never delivered**, and your bridge transfers will appear "stuck".
</Callout>

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Self-Hosted Relayer (Alternative)">

If you prefer to run your own infrastructure or need a relayer that runs longer than 3 days, you can set up a self-hosted relayer using Docker.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="l1">
  <ICMRelayer />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

### Instructions

1. Select **Fuji C-Chain** and your **new L1** as the networks to relay between
2. Fund the generated relayer address with enough gas on **both** chains
3. Save the configuration to your machine
4. Run the provided Docker command to start the relayer
