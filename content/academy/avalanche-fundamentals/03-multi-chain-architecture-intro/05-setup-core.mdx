To grasp the concept of the Avalanche L1s better we will interact with a chain. To do that, we will use Core. Core is an all-in-one command center built for multi-chain systems. It supports Avalanche, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all EVM-compatible blockchains. Core has a browser extension, a web wallet, and a mobile app. It is optimized for multiple chains and makes navigating between them easy.

## Managing MetaMask & Core Extensions

If had Metamask already installed, you could face some problems. We recommend temporarily disabling
Metamask for the time being.

Open the extensions page in browser. You can also type `chrome://extensions` in your address bar to open it.
Scroll through your list of installed extensions, or use the search bar at the top of the page, to
find the Metamask extension.

Once you find Metamask, you will see a toggle switch next to it. Click on this switch to disable the
extension. You can reenable it any time. When the switch is in the off position, Metamask is disabled, and you should be all set.
