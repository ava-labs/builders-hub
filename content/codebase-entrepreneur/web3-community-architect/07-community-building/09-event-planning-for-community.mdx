<div style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem'}}>

Events are powerful community-building tools, but require strategic planning:

Start with your authentic "why" - your real purpose. Ask:
- Why are you doing this event?
- Who is it actually for?
- What should attendees think, feel, or do when they leave?
- How will you measure success?

Create a one-page document outlining goals, target audience, desired vibe, and success metrics.

For successful events:
1. Create a detailed run-of-show and budget immediately
2. Set up solid communications channels and delegate tasks
3. Build events with your community, not in isolation
4. Partner with DAOs, protocols, and creators to share spotlight and audiences
5. Use tools like Luma/Eventbrite for RSVPs and Zealy/Galaxy for gamified engagement

Common event mistakes include assuming people will show up without validating interest, being vague about the event's purpose, skipping quality AV equipment, forgetting follow-up, and under-preparing for logistics issues.

Effective event practices include offering valuable rewards (NFTs, POAPs), designing for emotional impact through lighting, food, and music. You can also create exclusive experiences, co-hosting with strategic partners, planning for content creation. Finally, be sure to gather post-event feedback to improve future activations.
