The **eERC (Encrypted ERC)** standard combines modern cryptography with Avalanche’s high-performance infrastructure to deliver **confidential transactions** while remaining compatible with the EVM ecosystem.  
In this section, we will break down the key technologies and architecture that make this possible.

## Core Privacy Technologies

### 1. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs)
- Used to **prove** that a transaction is valid without revealing its details.
- Ensures the sender has enough balance and the transaction respects the rules, without disclosing amounts or balances.
- Highly gas-efficient when deployed on Avalanche due to its low base fees.

### 2. Homomorphic Encryption
- Allows operations on encrypted values **without decrypting them**.
- Enables balance updates and validations while keeping amounts hidden.
- Balances remain encrypted on-chain at all times.

### 3. BabyJubJub Elliptic Curve
- A **twisted Edwards elliptic curve** optimized for zk-SNARKs.
- Offers fast signature verification inside zero-knowledge circuits.
- Used in eERC for **efficient key generation and proof validation**.

### 4. ElGamal Encryption
- Public-key encryption scheme adapted for elliptic curve cryptography.
- Used to encrypt token balances and transfer amounts on BabyJubJub.
- Supports **homomorphic addition** so encrypted balances can be updated without decryption.

### 5. Poseidon Ciphertext Hashing
- **Poseidon hash** is a ZK-friendly hashing algorithm designed for use inside proof circuits.
- Optimized for minimal gas cost and high efficiency in zk-SNARK verification.
- In eERC, used for commitments and ciphertext integrity checks.

## Auditability Module
- Built directly into the eERC architecture.
- Enables **selective decryption** of transactions for authorized auditors or regulators.
- Permissions can be **rotated or revoked** without redeploying the contract.
- Maintains **compliance-readiness** without compromising user privacy.

## On-Chain Components

1. **Registrar Contract**  
   - Manages the list of authorized auditors.
   - Handles public keys for encryption and decryption permissions.

2. **EncryptedUserBalances Contract**  
   - Stores all encrypted balances for token holders.
   - Updates balances through zk-SNARK validated operations.

3. **AuditorManager Contract**  
   - Controls access and permissions for auditors.
   - Integrates with the Auditability Module.

4. **Proof Verification Circuits**  
   - Specialized zk circuits that verify transactions meet the protocol’s rules.
   - Operates without revealing transaction details.
   - Optimized for BabyJubJub, Poseidon hashing, and ElGamal operations.

## Modes of Operation

### Standalone Mode
- Token is **fully private** from the moment it is created.
- Total supply can be hidden from the public.
- Ideal for enterprise deployments or regulated private markets.

### Converter Mode
- Wraps an existing ERC-20 token into eERC form for private transfers.
- Allows unwrapping back into the original ERC-20 token.
- Perfect for projects that want optional privacy without changing their base asset.

## Developer Integration

- Contracts, circuits and scripts to be used.
- Compatible with Avalanche C-Chain Mainnet, Fuji (Testnet), and custom L1s.
- Does not require modifying the underlying blockchain protocol.

In the **next section**, we will cover **Usability of eERC**, focusing on Standalone vs Converter modes, real-world use cases, and how developers and users interact with encrypted tokens on Avalanche.
