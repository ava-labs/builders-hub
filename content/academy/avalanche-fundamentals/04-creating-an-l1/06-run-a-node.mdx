import AvalancheGoDocker from "@/components/toolbox/console/layer-1/AvalancheGoDockerL1";
import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/toolbox/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx";

Now that the P-Chain records are set up, you can start syncing the node with your Subnet.

## Run Your L1 Node

Use our free managed testnet infrastructure to instantly deploy a node for your L1, no need for Docker or Cloud Provider account set up with credits. Enjoy the benefits of:

- Instant deployment with one click
- Automatic configuration for your Subnet
- Free for testnet development
- Monitor and manage through the [Builder Console](/console/testnet-infra/nodes)

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="testnet-mainnet">
    <CreateManagedTestnetNode />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

<Callout type="warning">
Managed nodes automatically shut down after 3 days. For production or extended testing, see the self-hosted option below.
</Callout>

## Optional Alternative: Self-Hosted Infrastructure

The free managed testnet nodes are a great option for playing around with Avalanche L1s, but are not
intended for running on production environments. They are shut down automatically after 3 days. If you want to test out your production environment, running beyond 3 days, or anything more complex you should run nodes on your own infrastructure
using Docker:

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="testnet-mainnet">
    <AvalancheGoDocker />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>
