## Assessing Tech & Security as a Non-Technical Founder

For non-technical founders, evaluating your project's security systems may seem daunting. However, you can take practical steps to ensure robustness without deep technical knowledge:

1. **Rely on third-party security assessments**: External security audits provide valuable data points, especially for projects that will primarily live on blockchain.

2. **Implement vulnerability discovery programs**: Bug bounty programs or responsible disclosure systems create additional channels for identifying security issues before they become problems.

3. **Use security testing tools**: Leverage established security testing solutions as part of your development process.

4. **Prioritize security in leadership**: Ensure your technical leadership has security experience and fosters a security-conscious culture.

5. **Examine change management practices**: Understand how code moves from development to production, with security checks at each stage.

6. **Identify third-party dependencies**: Map all external libraries, services, and vendors your system relies on, as these form part of your overall security posture.

7. **Learn from industry incidents**: Stay informed about security incidents in the ecosystem and discuss with your team how similar issues might affect your project.
