import UpgradeProxy from "@/components/toolbox/console/permissioned-l1s/validator-manager-setup/UpgradeProxy.tsx"

After deploying both the the validator manager contract, we will need to link them by upgrading the proxy to point to your Validator Manager implementation.

Since the **ProxyAdmin** contract was deployed through the genesis with the deployer address set to the owner of the contract, we will call the *upgradeToAndCall()* function.

This will cause the **TransparentUpgradeableProxy** contract to (via *delegatecall*) call our newly deployed **Validator Manager** contract, instead of the empty contract it previously had set by default.
